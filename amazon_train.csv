"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",Bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby. She said her friends said it is the one item that she absolutely must have! Easy to put on. Now just waiting for the baby!,5
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"A perfect baby or first birthday gift. I received two myself as gifts.  I just finished one for my 5 year-old.  The last handprint. :(Perfect packaging, fast shipping.",5
CM Star Candy Heart Crossbody Shoulder Bag Satchel Purse Handbag Clutch,"It is very cute, and I got a lot of compliments.Pros-Really cuteCan hold my galaxy phone + walletHas a separate outside zipper for keys etcCons-It is a little heavy/clinky with the metal chain strap, but the strap also makes it look really coolIt swings around when I move so it's not very portableThere is a small decorative chain hanging from the bottom that is kind of long and is slightly noisy when it bangs on your legs when walkingIt's made well and is super cute though, and I would recommend it.",4
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","I have had 3 of these bags - i love it so much.  I have had one with each of my children.  It holds everything.  It hangs great on the back of the stroller.  It's stylish and just great.  But the zipper has broke on each of my bags.  One of the bags actually tore along the seam. I would recommend the bag, because the poor quality hasn't made the bag impossible to use.  I do love it.  If I have another baby, I admit, I might get another one of these bags!",3
Recaro Signo Convertible Car Seat Midnight Desert,I have used this with both my kids. It is the best car seat on the market and lasts through different stages!,5
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,This is the best monitor- better than the regular monitors and than the angelcare monitor. You can see and hear your baby. The bad rewiews I read are from people who don't use commom sense. To set up your camera - have the monitor in the room with you so you can see what the camera is seeing- then take it to where you want to view your baby. You don't have to go back and forth 100 times. The reception is clear-- if it isn't -- change the channel. If there is feedback from the speaker- the volume is too high. The many problems people have are easily solved if you use your brain. I can't believe this monitor isn't reviewed at 5 stars across the board. I give it my 2 thumbs up and take comfort that I can see my baby is sleeping safe.,5
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse","This is my second caddy...I also have the walrus...liked it so much, I bought a second one...the walrus I use as a diaper caddy...I cloth diaper and it holds 3 diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, diaper cream, as well as misc baby items (nail clippers, colic drops, etc) all in the main part...I am able to slip TV and heater remote in outside pockets, but if main caddy is full, the outer pockets feel tight...In the beaver caddy, I have floor and tummy time toys, a few Dr. Seuss books, teethers, rings, etc. When you first use it, it takes a bit for the bottom to lay flat, but once it does it will stand on its own.",4
Nuby 2 Pack Replacement Silicone Spouts,"I wish there was more photos/info about which models these fit. I searched the cups they were intended for and could find no model number on them (and of course I didn't keep the packaging - who does?), so assumed they were correct. Wrong! I'm out 2 bucks - they don't fit any I own.",3
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I like the contours, keeps baby safer on the table.  Waterproof is true, needs a cover though because the plastic is crinkly and cold.",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","We needed a crib for our grandson's visit and I liked the fact that many now grow with the child, turning into a toddler bed, daybed or full-size bed's headboard/footboard. I picked this particular crib because of the great product reviews and it seemed (and is) very sturdy. It arrived quickly and the packaging was excellent. It had been a while since we've had to assemble furniture so it took us a little while to put together. It was not too difficult, but definitely a two-person job. When my daughter saw it, she loved it - even more than the one she has!",5
"JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film Anti Glare, Anti Fingerprint (Matte Finish) for All New Kindle Fire HD 7 inch Tablet (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; 2013 released), with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack)",These screen protectors were easy to apply and no issue with getting the few air bubbles out.  Would buy again.,5
"Mountain Buggy Urban Jungle Stroller, Black Dot","I bought the Urban Jungle after extensive research... and love it!We were looking for a tough but stylish stroller that was suitable for the city, running, hiking trails and light enough to get in and out of a NYC cab.Great stroller! And the bassinet is perfect for a newborn.",5
Munchkin Bobble Bee Suction Toy,Very cute and keeps your baby entertained during meals.  The only reason why I am giving this a 4 is because the toy removes from the suction cup base very easily.  My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and can remove it quite easily.  I'd prefer it to stay stationary while I am feeding her and not have to worry about having to reattach it to the base multiple times during each meal.,4
Kidsline Zanzibar Musical Mobile,"Our baby loves this thing but it drives me CRAZY!!!  First of all, it should be battery operated because the wind-up motor doesn't last nearly long enough.  The other annoying thing is the stupid giraffe (which isn't even my baby's favorite animal, she likes the zebra) always getting caught on the post which supports the mobile.  This stops the mobile from turning and slows the music, they should have angled the post a little more over the crib so it doesn't get stuck like that.  Even with these two unfortunate problems, my baby LOVES this thing when it is working, it totally captivates her.  She is only a month old though, so maybe she will soon be annoyed like me.",3
Eco Sprout Detergent 48 oz. - Lavender / Chamomile,"I have tried several other varieties of detergent, and this is by far my favorite!  No &#34;off-smelling&#34; diapers any more!  It rinses clean and we haven't had to strip at all since switching.",5
"JJ Cole Lite Embroidered Bundleme, Pink, Infant",This product is very pretty but does not fit the Graco Safe Seat as it is too narrow and short for it.,1
"Medela Disc Collar, Slow Flow Nipple, and Clear Bottle Cap Replacement parts","this nipple is very good, the only thing that it made me give four is that it doesnt help with spit up but other than that its excellent",4
NuAngel Washable Nursing Pads 100% Cotton - Natural - 8 pads - Made in U.S.A.,"First time using these instead of disposable pads, and wish I would've discovered them sooner. They are softer and if you don't leak, they don't need to be changed as often. They don't stick, but also don't move around much-fine if you have a bra on, but don't stay in place as well with loose pajamas. Already bought a set for a gift.",5
Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,"I love these organic wipes! You can't beat the price, about a dollar a piece. I ordered some of the double sided wipes from Charlie Banana, and even though they are thicker, they are made of one side organic cotton, one side 100% polyester :S... These are just one piece of organic cotton with a hem.. A little thinner, but so soft and will get the job done.  Definitely recommend!",5
The Piggyback Rider Standing Child Carrier - NILOC Model,"Preparing to take my daughter who is 4 to the Olympics, I needed to find a way to carry her that would result in no neck pain for me and no need to visit a Chiropractor. As a single Mom I needed to find something that I could use by myself, and easily worked out a way that I could strap in my daughter as well as put her safely on in the rider.Pros:Awesome view for my daughterEase of Access : A stroller in this situation would be a nightmare with many restrictions for accessEasy Stored in a Back Pack (tho the bag you ship makes NO Sense to me)Cons:My daughter got tired standing up, and after about 4hrs we resulted to my shouldersHard to distribute weight to my hips and found that standing bar bumped against my buttAlot of attention - everybody wanted to know where to get one!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,This is well made and the bright colors attract my daughter's attention. If it was a little less expensive I would have given it 5 stars.,4
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)",The quality of this item is pretty good. Fabric feels light and stretchy. I like the zipper up top and on bottom (diaper changes should be easier this way) Unfortunately there's no way I could zip up all the way to my 9-pound baby's neck.(the item was the newborn > 13 pound size) The neck opening is just way too tight. Thank heavens for Amazon's great return policy.,2
Jeep 2-in-1 Baby Carrier,"My 1 month old son loves to be held and this carrier lets me meet his needs for closeness while still having hands free for the other kids or housework.  I am a mother of 4 and have tried every carrier on the market except the very expensive baby bjorn.  They were all complicated to use and weren't comfortable.I went to Babies-R-Us finally prepared to spend $100.00 on a baby bjorn.  While hesitating for one moment, I tried on this carrier and loved it even more than the baby bjorn.  It is VERY EASY TO USE.  We have only used it in the forward facing position so far.  One buckle on each side secures the carrier to the parent.  Then one slide lock buckle on each side secures the baby.  There is also a buckle on each side near the top to ensure lots of comfy head support for newborns.  It is very user friendly.  I also love that it does not have a waist strap.My husband is 6'2"" amd weighs about 240 pounds.  This carrier has straps plenty long enough to fit him and people much larger (or smaller).I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS CARRIER!!!",5
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,"I got this for a friend who doesn't know if they are having a boy or girl along with a really cute bib. I personally own these and think they are great! We use them on an every day basis, but if you lose a piece you aren't upset because they are so inexpensive.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany","This product was great.  The footprint kit was so easy, and it just has to dry for a good day, and then its ready to frame.  definatly reccomend this product.",5
Levana ClearVu Digital Video Baby Monitor with Color Changing Night Light (LV-TW301),"Not a clear night vision picture, bad audio quality. If i had an option I'd buy the Levana discont. product, babyview, way better.",2
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl","Love this owl so much, I have purchased it three times in the past year. Both Moms and babies loved receiving this!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I purchased this pumping bra after extensively reading others' reviews. I've used it for about a month and I love it. I work at a really busy office, and couldn't really afford to lose 15 minutes a few times a day to sit and pump. This truly lets me be hands free and I can work on the computer or do paperwork while pumping. It does take a little getting used to. The first time I used it, I think it took 10 minutes to get myself situated. I've got it down to about a minute now. It's very customizable, which is part of the learning curve up front, but means nearly everyone should be able to use it. I'm 36D/size 10-12 in most things and purchased the XS/S/M; it fits fine with a little room for expanding outward if I needed to and a LOT of room for making it smaller.",4
Oopsy Daisy Fine Art for Kids NL190401MG Train Engine Night Light,I bought this for my son's room since he likes trains. I expected better quality for the amount it cost. All it is a picture sitting on top of a nightlight. It wiggles and has fallen off a couple of times. It's cute but it is not worth the money they charge for it.,3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",this was the perfect gift for my nephew to brighten up his room at night.  It is very cute and useful too,5
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"This was the 2nd sippy cup I bought. It leaks, the plastic spout part comes apart from the cup. Worst design.",2
"Dutailier Ultramotion Bow Back Glider Rocker and Ottoman Combo, Sage","I just got this put together.  The first thing I noticed and aspect I can't get rid of is the smell.  The varnish or stain used on the wood is overwhelming.  I hope it is not dangerous or harmful.  There are no instructions for assembly and left over parts.  There is nothing in the packaging or on the product that states ""Dutailier.""  The only thing that says Dutailier is the box, which makes me wonder if this is a knock off.  I will be calling Dutailier Monday to verify.  It is gliding quietly but the ottoman feels like it is going to fall apart.  I have to run, the smell is making me dizzy.",2
American Red Cross Door Finger Guard - 2 Pack,Product arrived prompt and in great condition. My little one and a half year old thinks she is much older and likes to run around in the bedrooms and close the doors behind her. I like to keep her room open so having these finger gaurds are great because not only do they prevent her from hurting herself but they keep the door from getting closed. Win win situation. Thanks,4
Mother-Ease Sandy's Cloth Diaper - Bamboo - Small (8-20 lbs),"Just thinking about a little 20# baby in this thing makes me laugh... But the size works for my baby beast, who was already 36"" and 32# at 18 months... All the other cloth diapers and wraps were fitting him like teeny bikini briefs. The high rise and extra room for stuffing with hemp inserts make it perfect for nighttime protection, when paired with Engel or Disana wool (which are probably the only covers that are big enough to cover this whole diaper, anyway).Just the high rise alone makes me happy... Having a tall baby can be difficult sometimes, because it seems like almost all baby stuff is designed for short lard balls.",5
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,These strips are great! I can have a glass of wine with dinner and be reassured that my baby's not having one too. Takes all the guessing out! Best invention ever... if you're nursing and like to have a drink now & then.,5
Teething Necklace Jewelry - Organic BPA Free Silicone Chew Beads Teether Toys for Nursing Moms - Tiffany - White,"This is a very cute necklace that is also a teething necklace.  It is so nice looking.  No one would guess it was a teething necklace. If you have a little one, you might want to check this out.",5
Motorola Digital Audio Baby Travel Monitor,I've used this twice and both times it's worked great.  Even when the child unit is across the room from her I can hear if she wakes up.  It's almost too good. When set on high at both ends my family could hear everything we were saying in the bedroom.  Remember to unplug it when not in use ;-),5
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary","Other than holding the pieces to the Dr. Brown bottles, nothing came out clean and this really wasn't worth the money.I use the Avent microwave sanitizer and continue to use the hot dishwasher cycle first. Disappointing.",1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,These bibs seem like they will last a very long time. Get the job done and just throw them in the washer machine when dirty :) I bought some for both grandparents! Highly recommend.,5
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,I was able to hear noises being made a room away from where the base was located-- which was a good thing and speaks to the quality of the system.,5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","My granddaughter, two and a half months, holds on to this little caterpillar and don't loose her paci'. Beautiful. So glad I bought it. Might buy more in different designs. One of these little gifts a new Moms at times can't justify buying, a great gift for grandparents if baby uses this kind of pacifier. Very well made. Recommend!",5
Stokke Xplory Cup Holder,"I thought it was a little much to buy this fancy cup holder after spending so much on the Stokke Stroller, but it has been a necessity for our walks since the stroller is so streamlined, there really isn't any other place to put things right in front of you.  I use it for my phone a lot more than I use it for drinks, because I always like to have my phone handy in case of an emergency with the baby.",5
"Stephan Baby Ultra Soft and Huggable Musical Praying Woolly Lamb, Blue","arrived as advertised....good soft product.  Only difference, it was a little smaller than I had expected.  Overall I was pleased.",4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Love! Keeps his attention for hours. Does not hook on his car seat tho which is why I purchased it,4
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I love this carseat.  I actually went to have it professionally installed, and the technician said it was the easiest-to-install seat EVER with the click-tight installation technology.  She was a fan of this seat.HOWEVER, the reason I did not give it 5 stars was because (after I purchased it), I read that it had dropped in rank in car seat ratings AS A BOOSTER.  It's still great as a 5-point harness seat.  As a booster, however, the change in the armrest design (from the Frontier 85) makes the lap belt sit too high on the child's lap.  Britax sells a ""SegureGuard"" clip to fix this, which we purchased for when we convert to a booster.  I feel the clip is something you should have anyway, to prevent submarining in boosters.Please check for yourself on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website (IIHS).  They test and rate all the carseats & boosters.",4
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"This was suggested by a friend and it took me a while to get it. I didn't think a stool to squat would help me poop anymore than the myriad of prunes I'm told to eat.OH OH OH how I was wrong. Since I have had this, i have had NO constipation. Put your feet up there and boom, out it comes. Works with my kids and i highly highly suggest it!",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow Replacement Cover - Mauve,"Got this for my wife as a gift during her pregnancy.  She loved it.  I tried it out and loved it as well.  If you like the idea of a body pillow, but didn't like actually using one of the straight ones, this is for you.  If you're a cuddly or curl-up-to-sleep person, THIS IS A GODSEND!",5
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote,"I have been using this pump heavily for a year (full time working mom).  I have also owned the Avent ISIS Duo and an older style Medela PISA (circa 1990). Tthe 1990's Medela was the best.  It lasted through 3 kids worth of heavy, heavy pumping and was a work horse.  But they don't make 'em like that anymore, so pining away after it doesn't really help anyone!SUMMARY:If you are going to pump exclusively, you will need a good DOUBLE electric pump.  Depending on your situation, below are my recommendations:If you are have low supply, if you're struggling to pump enough, and/or do not respond to the pump well, I would recommend the ISIS over the PISA.  The ISIS is much better at extracting milk, BUT, it's also more cumbersome to use, the parts are heavy (so won't work great with a pumping bra) and there are a lot of parts to clean and keep track of.If you have good supply and your body responds well to pumping, then this Medela will probably be a decent (and convenient) pump for you.If you are OCD about cleanliness: Isis or Ameda Purely Yours (closed systems)IF YOU WANT THE GORY DETAILS (#5 being the most important, IMO)1. Reliability is questionable.  The pump stopped working after 4 months.  However, Medela immediately sent out a new pump, for free, which I receved the next business day.  Very good customer service.  Unfortunately, this happened on a Friday, so I was without the pump for an entire weekend.  I was lucky enough to have a back up pump, but not everyone has access to a back up pump.  Without a back up pump, it would have been pretty horrible.2. The suction is just so-so.  Even when both pumps were brand new, I could hear the motor leaking air.  I replaced the membranes, and the suction is improved marginally.  I respond very well to the pump, so this doesn't jeopardize my production.  However, if you don't respond well to the pump, it might affect your supply.3. The parts are light and easy to keep clean.  Compared to the Avent Isis Duo, the Medla parts are much lighter, there are fewer pieces to assemble, and the pieces are more durable.  The Isis had a few silicone parts that got gunky and gross after a while.  But all the Medela parts are plastic except the membranes, which are inexpensive to replace.  Also, the weight makes the Medela very easy to hold up with a pumping bra.  The Isis was so heavy, my pumping bra wasn't very effective keeping the horns attached to my boobs. So I had to hold them there and wasn't able to multi task while pumping.  Very inconvenient.4.  This is an open system.  Milk WILL get in the tubes. Dust and condensation will also gunk up the tubes.  If you're super OCD about everything being perfectly clean and sterile, be prepared to replace the tubing often.  Alternatively, look into closed system pumps (Isis and Ameda Purely Yours are closed). You will need to run your pump for a few minutes after each use to dry out the tubes or else mold will develop.  Kind of a pain, and this puts added wear on the motor (which is already weak, IMO, per my above comments).  You will need to replace the tubes every so often.  This also means it's only intended for one user.  This doesn't stop many people from buying used pumps, but technically, that is considered unsanitary and voids the warranty.5. You cannot control the speed and suction independent of each other.  There is a single dial.  If you set the dial to &#34;low&#34; = low suction, slow speed.  &#34;High&#34; = high suction, fast speed.  You cannot have low suction, fast speed.  Or high suction, slow speed.  On the ISIS, Ameda and old style Medela you can control the speed and suction separately.  This is an important feature, because each woman has a different combination of speed and suction they respond best to. And if you're struggling to produce, you need every advantage you can get and being able to completely customize the speed and suction could be a determining factor in your success. I always got the most milk using the ISIS with slow speed and long deep suction.  I could pump about 15-20% more using the ISIS.  But I had ample supply, so even with the Medela, I could keep up with my baby's demand.For me, the deciding factor in using the Medela as my primary pump was convenience.  But if I was struggling with supply, I would have used the ISIS as my primary pump.As a side note, you can pump directly into Evenflo and Dr. Brown's narrow neck bottles.  I used the Evenflo glass bottles and Medela collars and nipples.  Worked great.",3
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"I bought 2 of these. One to keep at my parent's house and one to throw in my bag when we are out. I love them. It's the perfect thing for my parents..My son visits a few times week and they can easily store this in their linen closet, no big, clunky potty, when he's not there. It folds up into quarters, so I have no problems carrying one in my bag around either. (admittedly, though, I do carry a huge bag) I keep it with a pack of Clorox wipes and just give it a good wipe down in between uses. The bag I store it in is machine washable so I toss that in the laundry once a week. I'd highly recommend this to anyone.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I've been really impressed with this pump. I'm pumping exclusively due to having a preemie in the NICU and I can get more per pump from the Avent than the madela pumps they have at the hospital. The only thing that didn't work for me was the silicone massage insert that prevented good suction so I simply removed them and have had no problems since. I've been pumping every three hours for the last 2 weeks so I can't speak of how long the motor will last but so far no issues at all. It's easy to clean and put together and the bag it comes in is nice, but the bag is the size of a computer/messenger bag so if small is what you're looking for then beware of the size",5
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,I bought this for my older son when we were caught at a mall without any activities in my bag.  It has been a great distractor & teether for 2 babies now - and I see no signs that it will give out anytime soon!  We love HaBa products!!!,5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White",I  love this gate! I  have tried MANY different types  and they  didn't seem sturdy  enough in our walk thru.  This one  is very sturdy on easy to open and close.  Worth every penny!,5
"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch","As the grandmother, I didn't really need a super fab highchair, since my grand-daughter is only here now and then -BUT this is the best!! By the time I bought this one my grand-daughter was 2 and she can climb in and out of it easily.The tray is nice and big, so it accommodates various plate sizes. Before long, we can just convert it to be a chair youpull up to the table, without the tray and center leg divide. I actually bought a second one for my son, since he recognizedhow much easier and SAFER it was than the smaller one he had.",5
Munchkin A&amp;H Disposable Multi-Use Pad - 20 Pack,"I use these with every dirty diaper change. If there's any mess, it makes it so easy to just wrap it all up and toss it! I keep a box on his changing table for at home, and I always keep some in his diaper bag for travel, too. I don't like to use public changing tables, so I change him in the car and just use one of these on the seat underneath him. They work like a charm!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Exactly what was expected,  love that it is adjustable.  Good quality.  I am able to work and pump at the same time which is a lifesaver.",5
KidCo Angle Mount Safeway  - Black,I am very pleased with my decision to purchase two of these gates (top and bottom of stairs). The gate is very solid and is easy to operate one-handed. I like how you can limit to swing open only one direction.,5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",Love how deep the cup holders are! Perfect and secure on my Baby Jogger City Select.  I also tuck the magnet center flap in sometimes to have the middle section stay open... I can hear my cell phone better that way.,5
Bummis Tote Bag - Red - Small,The size of the bag is fine but the opening is very narrow with very little give to it. It's hard to stuff a poopy diaper with minimal touching of your hand and/or the edge of the bag.,3
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","We've been using this for a few months now. It was easy for myself and my 3 year old to put together (she helped hold the boards while I attached them).I'm sure there's a weight limit and some reviews had said that even leaning on it cause issues. For us, I'm average weight, but currently pregnant (so not so average weight)  and I've sat on the bed with my toddler and with my three year old many times and it's fine. My husband is also average and he often leans on it when he puts our child to sleep. Again, I'm sure there is a weight limit that we've exceeded, so I wouldn't say to do that, but our experience is that it holds.I do wish we had one that had the rail run the full length of the bed on one side, but that is just preference. Thought I'd mention it as a consideration, but has nothing to do with the quality of the bed.It's affordable and we have no complaints.",5
Classy Kid Keep Me Coloring Creative Germ Defense Placemat - Pack of 20,"These are perfect for my toddler who can't be trusted with a dish yet. I don't mind if a plastic plate or bowl hits the floor at home, but restaurants all use breakable plates that I really don't want to worry about being thrown by my little one. At the same time, having worked in the restaurant biz myself, I know how gross those tables might be. I certainly wouldn't want to eat my own food off of one. And my kid is also too young to really do well with the little coloring sheets/ kids menus you get at a lot of places. She doesn't have the coordination yet to keep the paper in place while she colors.These placemats neatly solve both problems. They stick well, the pictures are great for coloring or for talking about (""What sound does the cow make?"", etc) while we're trying to keep her entertained during the wait for food. I love the fact that these do not used licensed characters, and they are not gender-segregated. And being biodegradable is the extra-awesome icing on the cake. I've just placed my second order of these. I know we'll eventually outgrow using these, but for now, they are definitely a must-have for our family.",5
"Munchkin Swaddle Angel 2 Count Blankets, X-Batik and Boomerang","i bought these as a gift, and I was very pleased with the packaging.  My sister loves them for her new baby and uses them often.  They are large and soft, and the patterns are even prettier in person.  The best part are the loops that allow you to hook the blanket and keep it in place, and even use as a nursing cover.  I wish I had these when my babies were born!",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I've had my gate at the top of the stairs for a year and a half or so and the safety latch that prevents the door from swinging both ways just snapped off.  I thought this would be an easy piece to replace as it only has two screws on it to remove in order to take it off and could be easily switched out; however, summer infant does not sell a replacement part for this item.  They want you to buy the whole gate in order to replace a small piece of plastic.  Unfortunately, I tried a few other gates at the top of my stairs and this was the only one that fit.  Please keep this in mind before purchasing this gate.",1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I've been using Osocozy prefolds ever since my daughter was born. At almost 1 year old and just under 20 lbs, she can still fit into the size 1 prefolds (i use the jelly roll fold and secure with a snappi to make the trimmest fit possible). Size 2 was way too big and I actually cut 4 inches of length off of all of them (after prepping them, of course) and stitched the edges to prevent fraying. There is no way any baby would ever utilize all that extra length. I use Thirsties duo wraps and compared to a size 2 completely unbuttoned thirsties cover, the size 2 prepped prefolds were 5 inches longer than the cover.They are very absorbent, resistant to stains, and get very clean in the wash. I have recommended these prefolds to friends.",4
"Combi BPA Free Teether, 6 Months","I like the fact that it has a carrying case. It's a bit thinner than the other teethers like Munchkins, Nuby, etc.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great walker because it's easy to maneuver. My son loves being in it. I love that you could pop off the the musical play thing and it becomes a food tray. That is a plus for me cause it keeps him busy while I get chores done.,5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","I have tried five different potty seats, and this is easily the best.  We have an elongated oval toilet, and this seat fits perfectly without slipping.  Next favorite is the Baby Bjorn seat...but is double the price of the Prince Lionheart.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Fantastic product. We absolutely love this for our 19-month-old; the tray system is easy to clean and so compact. My only regret? That we didn't get it months ago!,5
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","After one week of trying to breastfeed with a stack of four pillows, my back was killing me.  I was getting less nervous about dropping the baby off the precariously balanced stack, but still limited in where I could sit while feeding (not in bed, because the floor was too far away).  Not having a nursing pillow was not working out.My Brest Friend is the only nursing pillow I've tried.  It is a huge improvement over standard bed pillows or nothing.Plusses:- Much better than a stack of standard bed pillows or just holding baby up with no pillows.  Within three feedings, I felt much better about using the pillow, and my back did not hurt some much after feeding.  This is way more comfortable than any improvised home alternatives.- Cheaper than buying waterproof covers for a stack of standard bed pillows.  After all, if you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  I didn't care what color the cover on the nursing pillow was, so I just picked the color that was on sale.Negatives:- The cover for the My Brest Friend is not waterproof, and the inside pillow material is made of foam that absorbs moisture.  If you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  That's going to go through the cover and into the pillow.  You can pat the foam with water, but the pillow will be wet for a while, and eventually I suspect the baby will start to smell the accumulated spills.  I realize that most of the manufacturing cost for this is the material used for the cover, but any type of waterproof layer, even a cheap vinyl cover under the cloth would have been very welcome.-  Boppy has a waterproof cover www.amazon.com/Boppy-Water-Resistant-Protective-Cover/dp/B002WDEIVA/ , but I couldn't even find one for sale separately for My Brest Friend.- I have to hunch over to nurse with this, or lift the baby's head a few inches off the pillow.  For perspective, I'm 5ft 6inch, have a long torso, wore size 8 before pregnancy and only gained 10 pounds from pregnancy.  The other reviewer who mentioned hunching over said she was 4ft something with a slight build.  In a sense, it's a one-size-fits-all pillow, and plus size reviewers say it's great for them.  With thicker thighs, the height might work out better.  Maybe I'm supposed to have my feet up on something, so that I can control the height of the pillow with my thighs.  That sort of works, but it angles the pillow so that baby slides into me, and it's alarming for both of us.Other:- I suspect a nursing pillow is only for the newborn phase.  Once the baby develops neck muscles, I think he will be able to do more of the work supporting himself up.  Also, people breast feed in public with nursing covers, but I have never seen someone carrying a nursing pillow around for portable breastfeeding.  So, I suspect the nursing pillow is for short term use, and will be outgrown in a few months.  This may mitigate issues with not having a waterproof cover.If you plan to breastfeed, definitely get a nursing pillow.  This one was a huge improvement over standard bed pillows, and a big enough improvement that I am not going to try others.  As you shop, if you see any nursing pillows that have a waterproof cover, or any waterproof covers for popular pillows, those are worth investigating and paying more for.",4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet",absolutely waste of time and money!!!!  garbage instruction and product!!!  Not clear how to assemble and the assembly guide is ridiculously useless!!!!  The parts were damaged easily during assembly!!!!!  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!!!,1
Tiny Love Super Mat,"We have no carpeting in our house so I bought this interactive mat for my 5 month old. I put a foam mat underneath and it's soft enough for my baby to fall over and not cry. When my baby isn't playing with toys on this mat, she'll get distracted with the textures on the mat or the other attachments.",5
Kidsline - Luxury Blanket - Lavender,"These blankets are AMAZING.  They wear very well, my daughter has used the green one every night for over four years.  I bought two others, thinking the green one would wear out, but it hasn't.  These are super soft, wash very well and there is no fraying.  Awesome baby gift.",5
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Lemon - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/&quot;THE ART OF CURETM&quot; Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"Well, the first one broke so I left a negative review. However, I was promptly emailed and given the certificate of authenticity and a promise to send me a new one. Hopefully the first one was just a fluke. I will revise if the second one breaks. But I tell you what, customer service was GREAT. She's a homeopathic mom who has a few trusted manufacturers. And she wanted to do anything possible to help me and my teething son. I am thrilled and that is why I am giving a second necklace a try.",5

"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I loved these shades until it got cold here in Pa, and they won't stick now. Not worth buying if they don't work for more than half a year. Especially since it is very sunny in the winter time and my kids hate having the sun in their eyes. Can't return them now cause we used them for the warmer months.",1

"Ju-Ju-Be Changing Pad Bag, Midnight Eclipse",I bought this to match my other cobalt blossoms changing stuff and ended up returning it for a padded changing pad.  I realized that I may as well put the baby on a towel or a burp cloth.  I can't recall the name of it but I found a fantastic padded changing pad on Amazon that we love - look around.  This one looks cute but is kinda small and you can find better ones out there...,3
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This piece looked great after assembly!  I found out that I should have been more careful in putting nails in too deeply.  Some of the tips of the nails touched through the wood around the front edge of the dressing  pad frame. (I'm going to try to just carefully hammer those tips back in.  Hopefully, the finish will not crack.)I didn't feel there was a need for the piece directly above the cubbies.  I will probably take it off, for it shortens the size for bigger baskets.  Otherwise, this piece is super!!!  It looks great in my future granddaughter's nursery w/the matching chest dresser!",5
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,"I am a tummy sleeper.  With my belly growing, I was unable to sleep on my stomach and couldn't get comfortable on my side and couldn't breather well while laying on my back.  I was miserable!  I bought this pillow and it literally saved my sleep.  It is so comfortable.  My daughter is now 3 months old and I still sleep with this pillow.  It is a large pillow, but my husband and I have a King size bed so it hasn't been an issue.  The cover comes off easily so it can be washed.  I have been using it since I was around 20 weeks pregnant and it still hasn't lost its size or ""fluffiness"".",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"First of all I live in India. The pumps you get in medical stores look like bicycle horns, and the good ones==there's very little choice (I've seen a philips Avent, a Pigeon, and a Farlin, which are among the good ones, but I've only seen single models of each of these brands without much choice in stores). I just wanted to be sure, so after reading rave reviews for this particular one, I decided to go for it.I did not plan to pump too much because I work from my home office, but I have an oversupply and manually expressing milk to relieve the pressure was way too time consuming. I didn't want to end up with blocked ducts mastitis and all the other problems that come with oversupply. Before this pump arrived I was already battling a clogged pore.If you have a good supply of milk (evidenced by the fact that y our baby is satisfied after feeds, not by the amount you can hand express), then you will be able to pump enough with this manual pump. I used to manually express into a graduated bottle to see how much I could produce, and I would get 2 oz a side after say 20 minutes each and a lot of pressing and pain. With the Medela Harmony I am able to produce 4 oz from one side within about 10 minutes, no pain, no need to struggle. I don't even push the pump all the way.Pros:-This manual pump is good if you are an SAHM, pump to relieve oversupply, or pump infrequently for other reasons.-It comes with an extra bottle, lid, nipple, stand, and cap.-The two pumping strengths simulate the initial suckling to sitmulate letdown and the slower, longer suckling motions of babies.-The suction is pretty strong but it can be minimized if the handle is pushed down only part way.-It comes with an instruction manual.Cons:-The apparatus looks daunting at first with little parts here and there, but it's easy to get the hang of after a single dismantle/reassembly.-The pumping mechanism is directly connected to the bottle and flange, etc., so they come in direct contact with each other. This means everytime you need to use it, it needs to be sterilized/sanitized.-There is a tiny white &#34;washer&#34;-like ring that attaches the pump to the rest of the assembly. This came off while I was sterilizing my Harmony the second time after I bought it. Luckily I noticed it, figured out where it goes and popped it back on. Without this washer the suction refused to work. So watch out for the tiny parts.",5
"Dream On Me, 3 in 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry",Our nieces bedroom is small.  You add all the other furniture and the space became tight.  This Crib was an excellant purchase.  All the pieces were there and assembly wasn't too bad.  The crib is beatiful and seems to be built well.,5

Eddie Bauer Soothing Comfort Bouncenette,"We bought this product used before the baby was born and it has been a hit.  The vibrate option has kept him sleeping peacefully in the living room while the family moves around him.  I find the noises not at all soothing, but they seem to work for him!  The seat reclines fully, great for a newborn; now that he is 13 weeks old we have adjusted it so it inclines.  The biggest negative is that he is about to outgrow it so it is only good for about 3 1/2 months.  A big plus - the zip up screen.  We have two dogs in the house and by closing the screen we keep the baby protected from inquiring, slobbery noses.",4

DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I love, love, love this little thing! I can't believe how well it works and purees EVERYTHING, so smooth. I used a different product and made a fruit blend and was left with chucks, seeds and pulp from the oranges. Then I put everything in this one and it was a perfect liquid blend. I won't use anything else for my baby. It's small and light weight and can't wait until my little one is older and I can try to mash up whatever daddy and I are eating. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own baby food.",5
LASSIG Green Label Neckline Bag - Black Melange,"My girlfriend absolutely loves it. I wanted to wait to have our baby before reviewing, and now that we're using it everyday, I can finally say that it's a great product. Tons of pockets and space, great fashion design.Only reason it's not 5 stars is that there is not really any easy way to attach it to the stroller. There should be one little clip/strap on each side to attach to the stroller like I have on my diaper dude bag... So to put it under the handles you have to just ""hang"" it there by the shoulder strap but it's not ideal.",4

"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","Love this carrier! I purchased the BabyHawk Mei Tai because I was looking for something to easily wear my son on my back. I chose this over the Ergo mainly because of the price, but I'm extremely happy with my purchase. This carrier is versatile and comfortable. There is just enough padding to make the comfortable on my shoulders and back, and I love the variety of carries. My seven month old's favorite is a high back carry. There is a bit of a learning curve (especially with a back carry) as with any wrap or carrier, but once you've gotten used to it, it's quick to get on and off.",5
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink","Hi, we got this walker yesterday, it and my 7 month old has been inseperable ever since. He reaches for it if we walk by it he loves to honk the horn and push the buttons. I don't know what people are complaining about the bar in the back for, my son is 31 inches tall in the 70th percentile for hight and the bar don't bother him (have it pushed all the way back.) I am glad to have found this walker on amazon after getting ripped off of one on ebay. This item is no longer sold in babies r us or toys r us stores in this color in my area. They said I would have to go up north to get one and their not sold online. Red was the only color I wanted and the Jeeps wheels don't rotate (at least the one I had didn't). For those of you worried about the price go find something with in your budget the other colors are cheaper because you can't get this one anywhere else in some states. My son hasn't figured out he can move in it yet (he's never had a walker my older son had the jeep) but, he's figured out how to bounce in it and he loves that feature. I wish we could post pictures with our reveiws because I have the cutest smiley pictures from my baby in it and we all know how hard those are to get.",5
"Philips AVENT Tempo BPA-Free Liners, 8 Ounce,  100-Count","I love the Tempo system, because the rings are sealed (since it is a collapsable liner you do not need a vent) and do not leak like the regular Avent bottles do.  Also, you never need worry about BPA!",5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 5 (2 Mint Green, 2 White, 1 Blue)","I grew up pinning diapers on younger cousins, so I was skeptical, but they are super easy to use, and while the &#34;snappi&#34; can bite if you're not careful, pins can stick, and at least the snappi is plastic, not a metal spike! :) The only thing I wish would have been included was cleaning instructions. I use one per day and swish in warm water and mild detergent after use, but I'm not sure this is the best way to ensure the longevity of the product.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",We are still using this for our daughter in our Subaru Outback.

Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child.  I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work.  My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss.  Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects.",1
"Dr. Bloom's Chewable Jewels Necklace Circle, Lavender","I just got my chewable jewels in the mail, I ordered the blue circle necklace and bracelet to wear while my 4 month old daughter teeths. I was hoping it would look a bit more stylish, it does look like a cheap, plastic, chew toy. Although I am impressed by how stretchy the cord is, so as she gets stronger she wont be able to break it. Also it had a slight plasticky smell that I am hoping is from the packaging since the jewelry is phthalate free. I look forward to having a teether that cant fall on the floor, but because of the appearance I wont be buying any more of this brand.",3
"Solarsafe Stroller , Playard &amp; Pack 'n Play Net - 85% UV protection","This is an excellently designed product. The reflective outer coating  keeps the sun out, while the dark inside allows the baby to see out. Our five-month old is really enjoying the stroller rides now. The integral packing bag is a nice feature for putting the net away. You can't lose the bag because it is attached. The net  is easy to put onto the stroller and is plenty large. Very happy with the purchase.",5
DaVinci Emily Mini Crib - White,I was very happy to find such a nice crib at such an affordable price. I put it together on my own and was pleased how easily it went up. It fits well in the smaller space we have and looks especially beautiful/elegant for the cost. It's also very easy to move around if need be. Great Purchase. I would highly recommend. I do agree with others about the 2 in. foam mattress though and will invest in a thicker higher quality one.,5
EddieBauer Lht wt Travel System-Edgewood,"Do NOT buy this travel system because the straps on the carseat simply fall out while you are driving!  If you call the customer service dept of Costco, they'll send you replacement straps, but I haven't gotten them yet to see if they work.  I'm just glad I haven't been in an accident before this.&#60;br /&#62;The wheels squeak too, but that is unimportant considering your child can fall out of the carseat.",1
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I bought this seat for my 17 month old daughter and we love it.  The installation was super easy and rock solid in my Sienna.  The strap adjustment is smooth and did not require much effort on my part.  I plan to buy a second one for our other car so we can get rid of the awful first convertible we purchased, the Safety First Complete Air LX.  We loved the Britax seats we used 9 years ago and, so far, this one has been just as wonderful.  It's worth every penny.",5
"Baby Aspen Let The Fin Begin Terry Shark Robe, Blue, 0-9 Months","Got this for a baby shower gift and it was a huge hit!! The material is standard, not super soft or anything.  I am sure the sizing is pretty accurate for age 0-9 months.",5
Stroll-Air Double Stroller Organizer,"After a ton of research and seemingly few good double stroller options, I settled on this without much to go on the way of reviews. I wanted something that would span the entire width of our double stroller's handle bar and this turned out to fit perfectly. The Velcro straps actually have alot more length to stretch further if needed. I'm able to secure the straps tight enough so that the console holds pretty rigid, without sagging or moving across the entire width. It would work even better with the regular City Mini double stroller, which has a perpendicular bar in the center of the handle bar. The console has two separate storage compartments with space in between them to rest over that perpendicular bar. The cup holders are big enough to securely hold large drinks, like the souvenir cups at Six Flags. The storage compartments have a lot of space for all of multiple wallets, phones, keys, maps, sunglasses, and snacks to fit with room to spare. The magnets that secure the compartment covers could be stronger, but are fine for when the stroller is in use. I don't think they'll hold well when the stroller is folded up and there are still items in the pockets, but we don't keep anything stored in there when the stroller isn't in use so it's not a problem for us.",5
Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer,"I use this full of warm water and a wipes solution and dip in baby washcloths.  The washcloths it came with are the best I've ever seen!  THey are very thick and soft, so I decided to use them for her baths and use thin baby washcloths for the wiping.  The warmer keeps the water the perfect temperature.",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy, Aqua Drops","I got this cover so that I could keep my son in the shade when he is in his stroller (I have the Graco frame stroller which has no shade on it), and also to keep germs away when I have to take him out around people since he is only 4 weeks old.  The cover is nice and lightweight fabric, which is good since I am in FL and it is already very warm here.  It fits snugly on the carseat (Graco Snugride), but you can always peek through the velcro and check on baby with no problems.  I actually leave on side down when the baby is in the car, and it keeps the sun from coming in the window there too.  Only drawback is that you have to have the handle in the upright position to use the shade, since the straps attach there.  You have to remove the cover from the bottom the seat to move the handle back.  other than that, it is great!",4

Haven't tried the easy unassemble for easy storage yet. GREAT activity set for baby!,5
Bubble Guppies Stacking Cups,"I paid $2 more on amazon than I would have at Walgreens, where this is sold for $9.99. Wish the parts of each &#34;cup&#34; would stick together, but they don't. If you pick up a cup, the top separates from the bottom. Kinda lame.",1

"DaVinci Classic Sleigh Glider and Ottoman, Beige/Espresso Legs","I love my glider.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have only taken it for a test spin, although our little one should arrive any day now.  I do agree with some of the  comments that it can be a little snug in the hips and I wish the back was a bit taller for head/neck support.  But overall a very comfortable chair thus far and I really enjoy how padded the seat cushion is compared to other chairs I have tried.  Looks good too :)",4
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Quilted Waterproof Sheet Saver, Natural","LOVED these sheet savers. As the name states, these saved us many a sheet change. They pilled up a tiny bit with many washings, but stayed soft and held up great. We still use them around the house for when we need a waterproof surface, even though baby is past the sheet saver stage.",5
Phil Teds Classic Single Child Stroller w Doubles Kit,"I loved the stroller for the first 2 years, it was handy, slim and a great stroller to take shopping as its not wide and bulky like other double strollers. However over time the quality just in NOT there. The fabric has ripped and the internal piping is sticking out and one of the plastic buttons you push in to fold the stroller has now snapped off. For a $350-$600 stroller I would have expected this to last must longer. If you are only using for a year or two great, but if you expect it to last the time...well it just might now :O(",3

"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",I absolutely love this monitor. As a new mom I researched and researched many different kinds of video monitors and decided on this one. What an awesome choice I made. This monitor is very clear and has awesome night vision. I wanted to be able to see baby breathing and  it is so clear that you can see the rise and fall of their chest. The audio is great and I love that there are also light indictors to notify you if baby cries. It is very easy to use and set up. Gives me great peace of mind!,5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"Between our 2 children we have had both of the top selling Fisher Price models - the Ocean Wonders and the Papasan cradle swings.  While we have been happy with both, our favorite by far is the Ocean Wonders.  The mobile on it is SO much better, with the hanging toys and the lights.  My oldest son actually still plays with the fish toys that hung from his swing mobile when he was a baby -- he loves them to this day!  My youngest son got the papasan swing instead and while it functions basically the same the mobile just isn't very interesting in comparison.  Our papasan swing broke recently and Fisher Price (excellent customer service) is cutting us a check for a replacement -- we'll be getting another Ocean Wonders instead of the papasan.",5
Edushape Magic Creations Bath Playset - Under the Sea,"I was so excited to give these to my son for Christmas!  He is now 22 months and loves cars, trucks, buses etc.  I thought he would love these.  He does not.  He has no interest in playing with them.  He has no interest in sticking them to the side of the tub or anything.  It's strange, because he loves to take his toy cars and trucks into the tub and line them up on the side, but these, nope!  Not an inkling of interest.To me, these are cute and stick well to the tub (I've done that myself easily when showing him what they do).",3
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I used 5 pillows before, 2 for my head to be elevated, below my bottom, between my legs to relieve SI related pain and last below my belly to prevent cramping of the abdominal muscles in sideline. Now I just use one and havent slept better. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks since week 20.PROSAble to use it in several different ways to:LYING DOWNWear it with Long side on my back in sideline and it supports my entire back and stabilises SI joint instability relieving related pain, the section goes between your legs and it helps with SI instability and pain, it curves under stomach and supports it relieving the cramps on my ab muscles.Roll with it between your legs and it is more comfortableI have tucked under my hip bones when lying on stomachHead is elevated enough to prevent refluxSITTING UPUse it on soft couches that cause SI instability and painDecrease seat depth in couches and helped me sit uprightCONSWhen you roll depending on where it works best for you, you have to reposition. Yes it woke me up but i went right back to sleep.It takes a couple of nights of playing around with it to figure what works best for you. My sheets would get tangled up, back position worked better for me during my second trimester etc But once you have got it down, its such a relief!I dont know if the cover is cotton, but it got a lil hot for me, i just cover the exposed potion with my sheet and im fine.I might have to stitch a spare cotton cover that goes over it that is less complicated to put on.It took me 2 days of interrupted sleep because of pain especially while rolling to invest in this. But its been worth the money. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is just a trigger for everything else, its bad enough you have to wake up to pee. Havent slept better.I am 5'4, my friend who is 6'1 recommended it to me, so it works for different heights as well. Definitely give it a shot.",5
"BOB Sport Utility Single Stroller, Blue","This stroller is awesome! We use it to walk our baby and dogs out in the country on a dirt road. She sleeps, they run, and everyone comes home happy. It's rugged, but also has a smooth ride. It is one of our favorite purchases.",5

Soon as I received the item, I studied it and thought to myself that it would actually be something for me too since it's very flexible and very well adjustable! It's a very good buy!!!",5
"Foundations Quad Four Child Stroller, Blue","Positives:We enjoy using this stroller. The kids get a real kick out of sitting next to a buddy. It snugly fits through most doorways. The kids fit well, even the three-year-olds. An infant car seat can fit in one of the back seats and still have room for a toddler sitting next to them. I also like the automatic braking system that activates whenever you release the handle. It folds up well and just fits into the back of a 12-passenger Ford Heavy Duty van.Negatives:We probably don't use it as much as we would if it were easier to get it into and out of the van or at least a bit lighter. It is very heavy and awkward for one person to try and pick up or load. Also, when in the folded position, the wheels don't turn, so you must either fully assemble it or try and carry it when moving it between places. Because it is heavier, it is harder to take it on unpaved trails and it easily sinks and gets stuck in mud and gravel. It does okay on the larger bark chips often found at parks as long as there are two or less kids riding at the time.On a more technical note, the back seats are held up by two buckles. On ours, one of the sets of buckles is too tight to allow the ends to meet, so it is permanently in a reclined position. This is something that should be checked upon arrival (we didn't because we were using the back seats for infants and didn't need them in the upright position for quite some time)",4
Stokke Sleepi Mattress,"This mattress is extremely hard, which I guess is safe, but doesn't seem very comfy for baby.  It serves it's purpose. It is just overpriced because you have no other options when you buy a Stokke Sleepi crib.",2
UPPAbaby PiggyBack Ride Along Board,"My 2.5 year old son always wants to walk places...until we get very far from home or the car and suddenly he's just too tired to go on.  This is perfect because it's there with the stroller (I have a baby girl) and he can pop on when he gets worn out.  He feels like he has the freedom to walk and I don't have to worry about him begging to be carried.  It snaps on pretty easily, but be aware that you have to remove it to fold up the stroller.  One problem is that I feel like my feet bump into it when we're walking (I'm not very tall, although my husband who is 6'4 has the same problem), so I end up hunching over a bit.  It's slightly uncomfortable, but much better than carrying my toddler, so I think it's a small price to pay.",5
"Milk Dreams Sleep Bra (Small, White)","It said it was my size, but it's so small I fall out!  Not cool.  If you're bigger busted, it's not a great bra.",1
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","Since our son spends a lot of time in his forward facing baby carrier, it is great to have a way to keep his pacifier off the ground when he inevitably spits it out. It leaves my hands free and I don't have to worry about it falling into something horrible, which it always does. The metal clip on the strap has a locking mechanisms which holds it quite firmly, yet allows for it to be quickly and easily taken off.My one complaint about this thing is the package it came in. The little plastic T which held it onto its cardboard backer left a frayed hole in the strap, despite my efforts to carefully cut it off with some scissors. I don't think it has damaged it structurally, but it just looks ugly. Think about some better packaging!",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle",I like that there is a timer and this does not stay on all night. I think my daughter gets better rest that way. Having this helps calm her fears.,5
"Regalo Extra Tall Guardian Expandable Gate, White","In April, my husband and I bought this gate so we could keep our dogs out of the living room and off the carpet. We've been pleased with it, until this weekend when I holding one of our dogs in my left arm, and trying to loosen and remove the gate with my right. My forearm got caught in the middle of the 2 metal pieces sliding together, immediately leaving a giant welt and bruise. As incredibly painful as it is, I am so glad this happened to me and not my niece or nephew! Their fingers could fit in the space, and if it had happened their fingers would have broken!! I am so disappointed in this product, but glad we don't yet have children of our own for this to happen to.",2
Jellycat Bashful Lamb Soother,Jelly cat is a fantastic name brand but I don't find this particular product all that cute so I'm sending it back.,3
"DwellStudio Baby Squares Fitted Crib Sheet, Dove Grey",Thses crib sheets fit well and wash well. They have lasted the last 9 months and still look new! Love them,5
"Soothing Dreams Monistor with Remote Control, Fisher-Price","This product should be recalled!!! Within two weeks of bringing our son home, the light bulb burned out. We quickly discovered that the bulb can not be easily replaced. There was a constant clicking sound from the first day and within six weeks, the reception worsened to the point of pure static. The interference with our cordless phone was obscene -- far worse than the new monitor I've purchased since.",1
Kids Line Willow Organic 4-Piece Crib Set,"My neice and her husband are very much into hunting.  I had to find something that could be used for both a boy or a girl, and also something that had to do with hunting.  I thought this was very cute and it also had deer on it, which was right up the fether's alley.  They are very pleased withit.  Thank you so much for having this item.  Shirley Erlandson",4
"Stork Craft Rocking Horse, Oak",Arrived in time for my grandsons first horse for Christmas and it is soo beautiful. Came when promised and is very well made and easy to assemble. This I recommend to anyone looking for a great rocking horse it is well made and worth the price not a thin piece of wood and the finish is excellent.,5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"My daughter was tired of her 'baby' booster with the buckles. This booster works perfectly for my 3 year old, doesn't slip around in the chair (wood), fits perfectly, color options are great, super comfy and perfect size for her to reach the table.",5
"Evenflo Home D&eacute;cor Wood Gate, Natural Oak","I like this gate. It swing easily. We have a lab and a weenier dog and this gate funtions well to keep them in the family room. If I had one complaint it would be how the hardware goes together. It has an gap between the two pieces to allow metal brackets. I think it would be stronger if the two wooden pieces were up against each other. Our lab is about 90 lbs and puts his front paws on it. It stands up to that so I'm pleased.For childen this would be a perfect gate. Slats are close enough that even the weenier dog can't get her head through! It is attractive also, unlike the metal or plastic kind that look like prison gates.",4
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",This was a great investment for us. It was easy to set up and we had no problem. We haven't taken it out to use at restaurant.,5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,I have twins that are 10 months old and was thrilled to try this product.  We couldn't use our old bath ring seat because our new house has a tub with a textured bottom.  Problem solved.  This seat attaches to the side of the tub quite securely.  The seat has nicely rounded edges to keep from scraping the baby's legs.  A+++++,5
"Kids Line Velour/Sherpa Blanket, Fleur",My daughter loves this blanket! She will only fall asleep with part of it against her cheek. It is a very generous size and works well for our warm Texas nights. It has remained super soft even after washing. If I had know it was this great in advance I would have bought 2!,5
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I bought it for my friend, he felt that the product is very practical and very comfortable.I think he like it.",4
Superyard Colorplay Ultimate Playard,We have twin 8 month olds just crawling around.  They can get into anything and everything.  We use this mainly to cover our whole living room so they have a large play area.  We also purchased the 2 section Play yard extension and having the 2 extra panels sure helps.,5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,worked awesome for my porta crib i would still be useing it today if it didnt fly out of the truck while i was moving,5
Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 5oz (150ml) - 2 Each BPA FREE,I use these bottles everyday with the Medela Symphony pump & they are great. I like that they are kind of small bottles & not so bulky like other types.,5
Tinkle Tube Toilet Aid,LOVE the tinkle tube!!!!  Perfect for public bathrooms.,5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I am pumping exclusively since my 3 week old has had such difficulties with breastfeeding. Having my hands free to pump after 3 weeks of pumping with the ameda double electric breast pump is a relief. I highly recommend this product. Fit is great. I am a wearing a 36C right now and bought the S/M size.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open Top Take-Along Swing with Music and Mobile,"This swing is a great buy. We received it as a gift when our first was born. We already had a big swing, so I wondered how much use we would get out of it! The answer is...a TON! The size is great, I keep it in the living room because it takes up less space and I keep the big swing in the bedroom. It runs FOREVER on 3 C batteries. The music is a bit annoying to me, but the kids seem to like it. The ""mobile"" was in the way and annoying so I ripped it off and I am much happier with it now! It folds up nicely and travels well!",4
Fisher-Price Kid Utility Vehicle,"Saw a family with one at a mall and stopped and asked where to find it.  Only place we found it was here online, so we ordered.  It does take up some room, but no more so than a large single or double stroller.  Compacts fairly well and only takes about a minute to get ready for use.  With the generous weight rating, I can even pull my 9 and 6 year old together (without a great deal of effort).  Very stable.In the past couple of days, at least 5 people of stopped me to ask about it and countless others have remarked things like ""cool"", ""awesome"" and ""look at that"" as we go by.My only real complaint is that, unlike a wagon, the pull-handle does not turn the wheels - you must apply pressure in the direction you want to turn for the front wheels to head that direction.  Works fine while moving, but not too well when trying to turn it sitting still.  The only other ""negative"" is that I have long legs and sometimes run into my own heels while pulling.  I would like it if the handle were longer, but it so, wouldn't fold as compact.I would highly recommend this for anyone with multiple kids, especially younger kids that don't like a stroller.  My 2 year old can't wait to ride in it, something that we used to have to fight about for the stroller.  A fantastic product.",4
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce",very satisfied with the product and the speed in which i received it  i would recommend this product and this provider.,5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","We like these bottles a lot. The plastic feels sturdy and they hold up well in the dishwasher. They are easily to put together and take apart, don't leak, and our daughter easily transitions between breast and bottle.",4
Medela Lactina Select Hospital Grade Breast Pump - BPA Free #016SC01,I love this pump.  I also have a Medela Pump in Style and it doesn't compare.  The Lactina produces more milk and is significantly more comfortable.The seller has amazing customer service and is exceptionally responsive.,5
KidCo Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock,Bottom line.  These work and they are cheap.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because 1 of the screws snapped.  If they get stronger screws its automatic 5 stars.,4
"Kids Line Embroidered Boa Blanket, Jungle Walk",This blanket is so soft and it is also very durable. It has been so hard to find Jungle Walk themed items. So I was very pleased to find this blanket,5
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,My wife loves it and missed it A LOT when we slept over at some friends without it. Good choice,5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,it is very soundly then rolling (rolling motor sound). that sound is louder than music. one of the three hanging toys does not rolls.. than you are purchasing such thing for such amount it should work properly! i am unsatisfied!,1
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",My daughter has special needs and needs a car seat with good support and this seat has it.We love it.,5
Nuby Hot Safe Spoons 4 Pack BPA FREE,Arrived fast and perfect&#8230;good spoons&#8230;dishwasher safe..baby likes to teeth on them as wellso light but not too light&#8230;def recommend,5
"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months","This is not a sleepy wrap. This is a boba wrap- the company that took over the 'sleepy wrap'. It says Boba Wrap right on the package and on the product. They are not the same thing, but close enough that I will try it out. I loved the original sleepy wrap, and this one appears similar -except it is wider and the fabric feels thinner and more stretchy.Please stop advertising this as the Classic Sleepy Wrap when its not.",3
"Jeep Traveler Tandem Stroller, Spark","I needed a double stroller for my one year old and newborn and we took a chance on buying this one without seeing in person. I loved the fact that almost any car seat fits into it, it buckles in place like a seat belt. I have a small car so I really needed a smaller tandem stroller. It folded up about as small as my Safety 1st single stroller but the downside is it is heavier. If you don't mind lifting 40lbs in and out of the trunk it's a great. It took some learning on how to open and close but thanks to a couple You Tube videos I quickly got the hang of it. My only complaint is that the back canopy keeps falling off but I can deal with that. It also doesn't turn great but I don't do a lot of walking so its fine. Price wise I didn't want something too expensive because I plan on getting a side by side umbrella stroller when the newborn is older. It's a great buy for the price and I'm very happy with it.",5
Puj Snug - Ultra Soft Spout Cover (Aqua),"I just bought this faucet cover for our 9  month old son. It is soft, adorable and I can see how it would fit on multiple sizes of faucets. Unfortunately the material is rather flimsy and after a few seconds of my teething baby standing up at the faucet and putting his mouth on it, he bit a piece right off. I didn't realize at first and had to fish it out of his mouth on the changing table--thank god i saw it before he swallowed it as it was a decent size. They should make the product thicker and more durable so this does not happen and then it would be perfect, right now I worry it is a choking hazard!",2
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","Very large, but light and stretchty. works great to double swaddle our fussy little monkey. very breathable so she doesn't overheat.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We received this as a shower gift, and it's been tremendously useful.  We have a separate bassinet for night time, so really only use it for daytime naps.  It's lightweight and easy to move from room to room.  When I study I can rock it with my foot, using very little effort, and the baby will sleep peacefully and let me do what I need.",5
Star Wars Jedi Forces Full Comforter,"This comforter is really nice and the graphics are clear and colorful.  This is the second one I've purchased.  I wanted one as a backup should the original one ever wear out.  I have washed my original one numerous times and it still looks as good as when I got it. It has gotten a little softer with washings, but I think that is a plus. I have the full size and it covers my sons full size bed nicely.  I think this comforter is a super buy.  It arrived in the time promised.",5
CoCaLo Daniella Crib Bedding Set 8 Piece,,5
ThumbGuard LG (7-15 yrs.),"I got this for my daughter when she was almost 5 and it worked successfully. She wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she started Kindergarten to be a ""big girl"". She didn't fight with me about wearing it. In fact, she would remind me to put it on her after baths or when she got home from preschool. After about a month, she no longer sucked her thumb. BUT, that is when she started biting her nails. Since the product worked for her, I decided when my son turned 4 that it was time to get one for him. He hated it! He cried when I put it on and successfully pulled his thumb out of it every time. It didn't matter how tight I put it on, if he wanted it off, he would just pull on it to slip his thumb out. The only way to have kept it on, would of been to put it so tight that it would nearly cut his circulation off. (Which of course, would of been way to tight)  My point is...The child has to be willing to stop sucking thier thumb or be under constant watch so they won't slip their thumb out, in order for this product to work. My now 5 year old son still sucks his thumb :(  Also, I would reccommend getting extra wrist bracelets.",3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This is perfect for the spring/summer months because it's not too hot.  I intend on getting a thicker one for the winter months!  I love the fact that I don't have to worry about extra blankets in the crib and my baby really seems to be comfortable at night.,5
Cute Rabbit LED Changing Colour Bunny Night Light Lamp Decor Party Kids Gift (Soccer),The product appears larger than it's actual size and is cheaply made.  Would not recommend. Came in a damaged packaged and looked as if it had been opened and returned already.  Tab had been taken out so do not think battery will last too long.,1
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, Espresso/Beige","The glider is great, however, there is a tad bit of false advertising in the title, stated Glider AND ottoman, however, it is only Glider.",3
The First Years  Expandable Mesh Dishwasher Basket,"I am thrilled to have found these neat little dishwasher baskets!  I was searching for something that would allow me to put the straws from my toddler's straw-cups into the dishwasher, and this is ideal for that application!  No more digging for stray straws in the bottom of my dishwasher!  The mesh on the baskets is stretchy enough to hold cup lids and toys, too.  I am so glad to have found these!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",I have two of these and I love them. The gate extender also works wonders. You can easily mount them and remove them to any desired location. Will recommend to others in need of baby or doggy gate.,5
"Disney Princess High Chair, Princess Silhouette",I bought this high chair for my and I am so glad I did. The Disney Princess design with Cinderella is so cute and I love how soft to the touch the fabric is and that it came with the additional head support since my daughter is so little still but already starting solids. I also like how easy the chair is to maneuver around and how simple it is to adjust. Overall a great product that I highly recommend!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother,"We bought this after it was recommended in a few baby books as a great way to help your baby settle and sleep through the night.Well it worked for us with our 6 month old who still has it attached to her crib (she's now just turned 2) She still likes to play it herself when she first goes to bed and we occasionally hear it in the middle of the night if she's woken up. It seems to reassure her and she just goes back off to sleep without needing us to go to her.As a result she's a fantastic sleeper and sleeps from 7pm to 8am every night now, and I'm sure this contributed to her great sleep pattern.This definitely helps her to get off to sleep on her own, and soothes her back to sleep in the middle of the night (once mobile, she learned how to press the button on the front herself and would turn it back on if she woke in the night even as a young baby)She likes the light it gives off I think, as well as the soothing tunes. We've had to replace the batteries many times (4 'c' batteries), but that's a minor pay off for many restful nights. We would highly recommend it as a sleep aid for baby (and parents!)",5
"Boppy Prenatal Cuddle Pillow, Neutral","This pillow does it's job.  It gives me something to put between my knees to keep my hips aligned.  And, now that my belly is big enough at 27 weeks, it gives me some support there.  However, the part that supports your stomach is very thin and short so it doesn't really give that much support.  Also, I've only been using the pillow for a few weeks now and it already feels like it's starting to flatten out.  Honestly, I could have saved myself $35 and just used a regular pillow.  It would have been just as big and supportive.  I wish I had spent the money to get one of the full wrap around maternity pillows.  Even just a good body pillow, which I did end up getting anyway for some back support, is better.  Bottom line, if you're going to spend the money, get the good full support wrap around pillow.  Otherwise, just use regular pillows that you already have.",3
"Green Eats 2 Pack Divided Plates, Orange","I'm trying to eat the modern FDA food guidelines with an eye toward diabetic portions. I have particular problems with portion control (a blob of that, a little more, less of the other&#8230;). So these plates are my training wheels. The big portion is for non-starchy vegetables, one small for carbs, and one for protein. The colors are awful! But everything else costs a ton or has stupid pictures and words on them. I am very pleased with these plates. They help me think clearly about the balance I need to keep. That's a lot of vegetables when you look at it this way. No half a cup of peas drowning in butter. Try a nice salad or steams carrots and cauliflower. Yum.",5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","theses were bought for my two daughter who are expecting a few weeks apart. They are good quality and absorbancy. The girls said they were comfy (as liners could be, lol)",4
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",I have been looking for years for gates for daycare efficient and meet state requirments. This gate is perfect...sturdy...easy to install....adult friendly...older child friendly...reccomend highly!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My  baby is fond of the wings of the peacock.And he touches the wings and plays with it often.,5
niceeshop(TM) Rubber Manual Squeezing Suction Milk Breast Pump-Red,"I wanted to give this as a gift but was surprised at the quality of the plastic (pumps). One was broken however, I choose to get a refund instead for the one! No doubt I would order other products of stronger material.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.  I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don't need two hands for it!",4
Imperial Extra Tall Pressure Mount Safety Gate,"I bought this to keep my 2 cats out of my basement.. I like to keep the door open for wood stove heat circulation purposes. It works great! I've had it a year now and I've had no problems. I will note that the locking mechanism is plastic. I don't use it for my needs - just closing it secures it enough for my purposes. So I'm not sure of the longevity of the lock.. My CATS have never jumped this, and they are very curious about getting into the basement. It fits securely in the doorway and is very easy to open and enter and exit through. A great product that fits my needs.",5
BRICA Baby In-Sight Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,My son loves to look at himself in this mirror and it is easy for me to look back with the rear view and see him. There are multiple ways to secure to the back seat for different vehicles.,5
Summer Infant Spout Protector,"Works like it's supposed to, my monkey boy doesn't scrape himself on the faucet while taking a bath anymore. It holds on tight and looks cute. The only downside might be that you have to take it off every time you want to take a shower if you have the integrated shower switch on top of the faucet (you are unable to get to it otherwise). Other than that little inconvenience, I highly recommend it!",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I do agree with the other reviewers, my son does enjoy his seat, esp the vibration mode..however, the sound is really annoying! The ""bubbles"" sound is so loud that if I am on the phone and it is on in the background people will stop and ask what that noise is! My older kids and husband hate the sound too. I suppose not too bad of an inconvenience if it is entertaining your child. Still, if you are noise sensitive, try it out at Babies R Us first. On a positive note, it is well made. My son is tall and big for his age and the chair seems longer than most, enabling him to stay in it longer. He is now 5 mos and it still fits.",3
American Red Cross Car Child View Mirror,"This is the third mirror that I purchased and tried.  The first one would not work with my mirror and the second was such poor quality that the reflection is useless.  The American Red Cross mirror is very simple to install and the mirror is of sufficient quality that I can see what my little doll is up to in the back seat.  Because it has a ball socket connection, I was even able to turn the mirror vertically to see her whole car seat.  Great product for the price!",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Sensory Plush Pals, Dragonfly",I bought one of the Zebra and one of the giraffe.  My granddaughter and great-granddaughter love them.  I attached them to their tummy-time mats and my granddaughter will fall asleep holding onto her zebra.  It is the first toy she reaches for.,5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"My daughter's daycare had this Octivity Time and they attached it to their bouncer chairs, so the child would have something to manipulate while sitting...My daughter LOVED this toy...You can also attached it to infant carriers/strollers/etc.  There are a numerous activities for the child to play with and the colors and sounds make this engaging for a young infant.  I have just gifted one of these to one of my daughter's caregivers that is pregnant.  High recommend!!!!",5
Munchkin Travel Booster Seat,"It's a diaper bag and booster seat in one. It also has legs with rubber feet so you can easily use it in a booth. It's an incredible product for the price, which I got for under $25. The only downside is having to be careful to not get the buckles mixed up. I accidentally buckled the left belt to the right slot (or vice versa I don't know) and it got stuck. I had to buy a new one. This was after having it for several months with the normal amount of wear and tear so I wasn't that upset.",4
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This was exactly what I expected when I ordered it.  A simple, rubber cover to prevent bumps and bruises from the bathtub faucet.  It took maybe 10 seconds to fit to the spout.  The fins on the side pull tight to varying sized faucets.  Seems like sturdy rubber.",4
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","I have this in pink and blue for my son and daughter.  I've had SEVERAL types of sippy cups and bottles over the years!  I consider myself somewhat of an expert by now lol...Ok so the issue I have with these straw bottles is that sometimes they leak.  Also I thought the whole point of buying a stainless steel bottle for your kid is to AVOID PLASTIC, but then they have a plastic straw right in them, and unless you are very good about washing them IMMEDIATELY bacteria and odors can accumulate inside the plastic straw parts.  And not everyone realizes the piece that the straw goes into, ALSO needs to come apart into 2 pieces for washing!!  I didn't realize that at first with my son's and it got nasty! :(  I had to order replacement parts from Thermos as I was too grossed out and even after good cleaning the smell wouldn't go away.  It can be hard to tell those are 2 pieces and not 1, unless you look very closely.  That may have just been on the blue model actually, which is slightly larger, but they also make the pink one in that slightly larger size and I imagine it is the same on the inside.  But with both models of the Thermos steel straw bottles, I think it's a pain to clean all the little pieces.I also tried a Klean Kanteen 12oz. sippy but since it wasn't insulated, it was very cold for my daughter to hold and it sweat and lost temp quickly.  I found that the Foogo also did not insulate as well as I hoped.  So I bought a Hydro Flask and tried the Klean Kanteen sippy adaptor on it and it worked!!  It does NOT leak, the temp holds well and it doesn't sweat... I'm a happy mom now!!",4
"Frenchie Mini Couture Tuxedo Bib with 3D Applique, Black",It's more of an instant-halloween costume than anything. Since the design is appliqued on it won't fade or come on in a wash like similar products that have painted-on designs. I recommend this product whole-heartedly.,5
Learning Curve Baby's First Links,I wish I had read the reviews for this and realized that the product has false advertising -- I received the same set of flower / star shaped CHEAP links.  Do not order this product!!!,1
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce",This thermos is well constructed and leak proof. Just what I need for 7 year old triplets. I recommend for all children who have trouble taking care of fragile things.,5
Disney Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Pillowcase,My Granddaughter loves any johnny depp items.  This was a big hit at her birthday party! I will be getting more.,5
"Swing Baby Toddler S-26R Full Bucket Seat Swing (no Rope or Chain), BLUE",Great swing. This is just as durable as the ones at the park. My grandchildren love it!! Good value for the money.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,This Jumperoo was a favorite of both my children! It is a nice size and not too heavy but very sturdy. I only wish my children could use it longer!,5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I have to keep my two year old away from her TV and toys stored in her armoire. I was using bungee cords to hold the doorknobs together, but this is so much better. I like that the latches can be removed entirely, and that they can also swivel out of the way. They aren't exactly easy to remove and replace, but if they were too easy to use, they wouldn't be a deterrent to my daughter. As other uses for these arise, I can totally imagine buying more of them. They are great!",5
Elephants Snooze Sack,"I love this sleep sack. I love the comfy strap around the middle. It serves two purposes. One to keep sack in place about and not ride up around face. Two, it keeps belly warm. What I don't like. The size medium is nothing like halos medium. More like a halos small. So baby will. Grow out of this too quick",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We love this seat. It is our baby's favorite place to be put down. He'll play with the toy bar, watch the lights and rainforest friends until he falls asleep. The 4 D batteries last a long time, but I still would recommend getting some good quality rechargeables for it.",5
"Racerback Relaxed Hands Free Pumping and Nursing Bra - White, Large",Great for pumping not so great for nursing. If you use it for nursing then you can't keep you boobs in it,3
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","Haven't used the product yet, still waiting for the passenger.  However, I did wash it and it held up well.  I hung it out to dry.  Being a first time mom, I'm still not quite sure how to place this in the car seat, I'm hoping the nurses at the hospital can show me when the time comes.  The package didn't have instructions that I saw, just a picture of a super cute smiling baby.  I haven't read the Britax car seat and stroller manual either, but I'm sure we'll figure it out. LOL",5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner, Orange","It cleans the bottles fine, but the bottom twists off if you turn it counterclockwise, so you always have to turn the handle clockwise. Also when i take the brush out of the bottle, I get a spray of soap no matter how slow I take it out.  I got it because I needed a brush with a handle i can on a hook and with no sponges on the tip.  I'm going back to Nuby.",2
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","This seat fits great in my 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.  I have also installed it in a Nissan Versa.  I love the high weight harness.  My 5-year-old son will probably out grow it by height before weight.  There is a spot to store the manual, but you can't get to it with the seat installed.  It makes it kind of useless if you are referring to the manual during installation.",5

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",Its a good product. Our baby is enjoying it.The projector works fine and music has 2 volume modes - and speaker is pretty good.No issues so far with the product - the projector is a good distraction for kids.We also don't use the projector all the time - sometimes we just put in on music and moving mobile mode.,5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Bangle,"Well, I don't know who came up with this idea, but I wish I had! It is beautiful enough for me to wear, if my daughter will let me. She plays with it constantly. I am going to have to buy the necklace that goes with it. Very pleased with the whole process.",5
Dragons Wooden Ceiling Mobile,I love this mobile.  I was looking for something that was different and would add a whimsical feel to the nursery.  I didn't want a nursery where everything matches and looks like it is from a catalogue.  This mobile is perfect.  It is great for a boy or girl.  It is supder easy to put together and beautiful.  I would highly recommend it if you are looking for something unique.,5
"Anna Claire Beautiful Designed Baby Receiving Blanket, Double Sided Designs, Swaddle Blankets (Under The Sea)",I chose that rating because of the details.My daughter and son-in-law chose this for their baby. She plans to make the nursey with flowers and butterflys. You got the order out in good time.,4
Graco Travel Lite Table Chair Tango in the Tongo,"We have multiple versions of this same chair and all we can say is ""It Rocks!"".  While it looks a little ""old school"" and there are cooler looking versions out there, there are some huge selling points to this chair.  One, it clips on quickly and is sturdy (no bounce).  Two, it can be completely wiped down after each use (no cloth which is huge when kids are messy eaters).  Three, the clip on tray.  Who really wants their kid eating food directly off the table in a restaurant?  And, the tray can go in the dishwasher, even better for clean up.  Buy this chair!",5
Baby Playpen Kids 8 Panel Safety Play Center Yard Home Indoor Outdoor Pen Playard,"I was a little hesitant when deciding to purchase this playpen because it wasn't a name brand playpen, but I'm  glad I went with this one. The product came on time and the panels were packaged well. It took me about 15 minutes to unpack and build the play pen.(I left the stickers off just in case they might peel off.) The play center is sturdy enough (on carpet) for my 3 year old boy who loves to climb over it and the toys are perfect for my 13 mth old. I haven't tried it outside or on hardwood floors yet. As  soon as I completed building the play pen, my 13 mth old who crawls everywhere decided to walk while in it. I was floored!!! It  must have boosted her confidence knowing the rails weren't too far away just in case she got tired. The only reason I gave this playpen 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instruction manual was confusing. So I built it by just looking at it, and by all means, it was easy to figure out. You really don't need the instruction manual, but for those who like to read manuals like me, it was a waste of 5 minutes.",4
"Thermos Ice Mat, 9 Cube","I suppose you get what you pay for. Theses are only a couple of dollars each but honestly, they're not worth that. I bought 4 less than a week ago and already two have leaked more than one square. One of those leaked the first day I used it. I use them in my baby's bottle carrier to keep the milk cold on the way to daycare. If I have to replace one a week, that's too expensive for me. So...my opinion, the material they use to hold the water in the mat is too thin and likely to puncture too easily. Boo.",2
My Hikes--Adjust kids pant legs! (Butterfly),I bought these for my daughters jogging pants that are too long for when she is crawling around the house and trying to stand up.  They do the job and are cute but I do not feel they are worth the $12 price.  Honestly they seem to be a $5 if that item.  The plastic does not seem really sturdy so I am careful not to bend too far for the fear of them breaking.  If they were cheaper I would probably order more but at $12 a pop - no way.  I gave four stars for the fact they do what they are made to do and are cute but would give one star for price.,4
Pink Girl Mini Rubber Ducky - 24 Count,"Cute for baby shower, but are much smaller than advertised, but still super cute! We are using these for my baby shower as my favors! Will be a huge hit I am sure!",5
Baby Emporio - 6-12 Months - ALL BOY Tights - Anti-Slip,"Great product. Must have for winter. Fits great under my baby boy's pants and looks great as it seems like he has shoes, yet at the same time, I don't have to worry about his socks falling off!",5

"Claessens' Kids Kid'Sleep Moon Nightlight, White/Blue","Like other reviewers have said, it does take careful reading of the instructions, consistency, and double checking the settings on a regular basis.  Once you get in a routine, it is WONDERFUL!!!!!  Our 3 year old daughter won't come out of her room until the bunny wakes up at 7:30am, or if she doesn't nap, she still knows she has to play quietly in her room until the set time.  Make sure you don't let the little ones try to set it or play with it, they can accidentally turn the audible alarm on or switch it to weekend mode.  There are a lot of settings and options, but that's great if you're patient!  It has 12hour and 24 hour time settings, so 7:30pm and 19:30 as an example.  It can be set for a weekday wake up time, a weekend wake up time, and nap time.  It just quietly switches from the sleeping bunny picture to the awake bunny picture.  You can set it to actually make an alarm noise, tweeting birds as an example, for older kids that may need to get up for school.  It was bright at first as our daughter slept in a completely dark room, but she adjusted to it after about a week.",5
Ecopiggy Orthodontic Natural Pacifier (1pk) (0-6m),"My baby likes this pacifier, but then again he is not picky and likes mostly any pacifier. I wish this pacifier came with a lid, something to protect the nipple when the baby is not using it. I've noticed that fabfic partials tend to stick more on this item, maybe because its sticky rubbber? Not sure, but I wish it had a cap like some of the NUK pacifiers have. Other than that , I like it.Don't forget to put the pacifier in boiling water before use..",4
Medium - Imse Vimse Training Pants (28-37 lbs),"These training pants are great but a bulky.  They will absorb any normal accident.  However be prepared to to have a spare set of clothes for the heavy accidents.  I would recommend you wash and them inside out.  The one down fall, no snaps.  If your child goes poop you'll have too pull the training pants down the legs to get them off, meaning you may have poop smudges down the legs.  Because of this I'm rating these a four star.  Eventually I did find training pants with snaps on the side (Tinkle Time  Trainers)  It made potty training more enjoyable and less messy.",4
"Kids Line My First ABC 6 Piece Crib Set, Multicolor","This bedding is very versatile for a boy or a girl. There are lots of sheets to match it. I made some brown curtains to go along with the valance. The quilt is very cute too. I also purchased the rug, lamp and 3 animal pictures that go with it.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop, Aqua, Size 1",These Thirsties make the concept and process of using cloth diapers a real deal.  Basically you are getting the leak proofing (elastic) you would get from disposable diapers with the convenience and re-usability of a cloth diaper.  Pattern is unisex so this works for both genders (if you're conscious about that).  It's the type of product that sells it self - meaning once you show other moms and dads they can really the value ($$$).,5

"OsoCozy Factory Seconds Prefold diapers, Infant 4x8x4, Bleached","I just received these diapers today, and they were in very good condition. I also don't see why they are factory seconds. All the stitching is great. I have not put these on my little one yet,as I am still pre-washing them. I have already washed them twice, and they are drying on the line for the second time. They have not shrunk much, as I don't own a dryer, and I am still waiting for them to quilt as nicely as I would like(though they are quilting). I'm assuming another two washes will get them the way I would like. And I'm sure they would quilt up faster in a dryer. These are long and thick, so I think they will be a bit bulky. But, as my boy has a tendency to pee like a fire hose, I'm actually looking forward to a bulkier diaper - maybe he won't hose these down in one hour! Can't wait to try them out.",4
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","Does the job well, no leaks and the funnel shape on the lid helps to get the powder in the bottle easily.",5
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce",Love these bottles. Used with both my children. I end up using the wide neck nipples though. My favorite bottle.,5
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,"As much as I love (see other review) the Diono Radian RTX, I really feel that this piece should have come with it.  When you pay $300 for a car seat, you really shouldn't have to buy any accessories.",4
"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 8-Ounce","These are great. I started using the Lifefactory WeeGo bottles, which I really like, but I was freezing milk in bottles and once I realized how many bottles I would really need, the price of the Lifefactory bottles, plus their caps made the prospect rather daunting.I have been freezing in these bottles for about two months. I had one bottle burst, but that was my fault for filling it too full. And other than my horror at having lost that milk and the bottle, no harm was done. The bottle was still frozen, so there was no mess to clean up in the freezer. I simply removed it.The bottles come in a really thick box with six compartments. Each compartment has the bottle with its shelf packaging. While I don't need the shelf packaging, I really liked that the divided box, because I hope to have more than one child and can see putting the bottles away in these boxes in between children to keep them from breaking.I still prefer the look of the WeeGo bottles, but the price is right on these bottles and although they don't have the silicon sleeve, they are pretty heavy duty and I haven't had any trouble with breakage from normal wear and tear.",5
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We started using this booster seat when our daughter turned one.  Mostly we use it for family functions outside our home where there are no highchairs.  It allows me to be able to eat with the rest of my family without having to hold Brooke on my lap or feed her first.  She sits securely in her seat right at the table with us and can feed herself.I love how compact it is - especially when there is so much stuff to lug when travelling with a baby.  In fact, I just keep it in the back of my SUV.  It is easy to clean - I have put the whole thing right in my dishwasher.The only thing I feel that could be improved are the retractable straps.  It is difficult to tighten the straps which secure the booster onto a kitchen chair - a bit stressful when you have a hungry toddler anxious to eat.But, for the money I feel this seat overall is a good buy.  Would definitely recommend to others.",4
"Trend Lab Jersey Message Bibs (Set of 3), Photo with Baby/Blue","This is really nice. I will buy this for other gifts. The bibs were just what I was looking for, Nice.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The Sophie Giraffe has been a favorite of my son since he was 2 1/2 months old and could hold it for short periods of time. He is now 8 months and still loves it. He uses it to chew on when he is teething and uses it to play with when he is not.  It was a great investment.,5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",We use this everyday and almost all day long. Since I have 2 kids and I am nursing one. I can talk to my son in his playroom while I am nursing. This way if he is getting ready to do something he is not supposed to be doing I can tell him to stop. This is great since latching on for nursing is a little difficult.,5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda  Atmosferra Stroller, Nero","I wanted a stroller that was very stylish, but not over priced...and that is exactly what I got. It has some weight to it which I like, and we always catch people staring at it!!!",5

"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","I got this sippy cup because of its stainless steel interior but it was a bit heavy for my then 1year-old son.  He could carry it, but it was hefty.  It also can damage wood floors when dropped or thrown... it is quite heavy when you put liquids in it.  Additionally, it is not easy to remove the outer shell for cleaning.  I know you don't have to, but over time, there has been trapped liquid and food matter that needed removing. Lastly, the lining inside developed some kind of black mold that I couldn't get out.  So I have tossed it.",2
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","I really liked the carseat itsself, but had a difficult time getting one of the straps to tighten once in the car. This made me very nervous, so I decided to return and go with a different brand.",2
JJ Cole System Bag - Cocoa/Clover,"Loved the style and compartments of this bag, but it hasn't lasted long. My Similac free bag has held up better than this. The zipper is completely shot. I definitely expected more quality for the price.",2
"Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","I am giving 3 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that this stroller is quite big, bulky, and heavy, even when folded up. I am a petite woman, and I can barely lift it. The wheels are also bigger than I anticipated.Having said that, though, otherwise it seems to be very good quality. The fabric and materials are all quite nice. It looks like it will be comfortable for Baby, and still easy to clean up. Our Graco Snugride pumpkin seat snaps in easily. The 3-wheel design makes it easy to maneuver, in spite of its large size. Also, I suspect the large rubber wheels will do very well on long outdoor walks or trails. I like that the handle adjusts up & down depending on your height. Also a good amount of storage space underneath.Overall, I would recommend it. We were deciding between this and the Baby Jogger City Mini or City Micro. We chose this one, due to the fact that it was a fraction of the cost. However, it is nowhere near as compact or light as the Baby Jogger designs. Just be aware of this before you buy, so you're not surprised.",3
The First Years Babypro All In One Baby Food Maker,It was a lot smaller than I expected. It would be nice for someone that is just going to steam down more whatever they are having for dinner themselves....but for somebody that makes large batches of baby food at a time I would just stick with a good steamer pot and processor.,5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss 4 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce",i've used take and toss cups for several years.  well for child number 3 i found these.  the handles actually hold the lids on so when the kid takes and tosses the cup off the high chair the lid doesn't fly off as it does without the handles.  they are a bit of a hassle to get on but totally worth it.,4
"Skip Hop Reversible Plush Blanket, Alphabet Zoo",I love this. It's very soft and looks to be well made. You won't be sorry. Just buy it now.,5
"Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink","I have used these bibs for years for my toddlers when they start to self-feed.  They really do catch a lot of the food, if not all.  The bib stays on and in place.  And they're easy to clean.  Sometimes I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher.  Other times I have put them in the washing machine.  Mostly I just wipe clean and hang to dry.",5
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,The rings come undone quickly without much effort. That makes it difficult to hang things from these but they meet my needs.,3
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",It was easy to put together. My 13 year old son did it for me. It has been really nice to have with us in the living room. The changer is nice so you don't have to place him in the crib and bend over as far. The price was nice too. $20 cheaper than the same ones in store.,5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 4 Pack Bunch-A-Bowls with Lids, Colors May Vary","I tried putting these bowls in our microwave at 20 percent power for 10 seconds, and they started to spark and food (strawberries and green beans) had burn marks on them. The bowls are a good size, the lids snap on well, and they do fine in our dishwasher, but you may not be able to use them in the microwave - and they are clearly advertised as microwave-safe.",2

UPPAbaby Vista Cup Holder,"I agree with most others on here, Love the stroller, and have no complaints on the other items we have bought. The cup holder is just not worth the money.  It does not stay on when the stroller is folder up. The chain breaks easily.",2
Bamboobies Boob-ease Therapy Pillows + Pair Bamboobies - 2 ct,"These are THE BEST for sore, engorged nursing boobies!  I've tried so many different ways of soothing the pain during the first couple months of nursing and nothing compairs to these therapy pillows! I loved them ""cold"" for easing the pain of engorgement! When I felt like I needed to open milk ducts that were not fully emptying during nursing I would warm these up and stick them in my bra. What a relief! I get these for every new nursing mommy friend I have!  I feel like it makes those first couple months of nursing a lot more comfortable!  It's a total ""pamper me"" product for nursing mommies!  Worth the money!  Buy them!  You won't regret it!!!",5
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand Ultra Tandem Stroller, Phantom","Updating:  1 minor set back to be aware: the stroller can tip backward when you have the baby or baby carrier on the back and the front passenger gets out of the front sit or you park the stroller up hill. Don't have too many bags on the back either. What I did to counter bakLance the wt is having your bag or something heavy in the cargo basket I also tried using the gym wristband or ankle band weight and wrapped it around the center if the stroller and take it off before folding. Works like a charm.Originally I got the Joovy Ultralight b/c it said 21lbs so I thought it was light. OMG it's 28.2 lbs (both mfr and my scale) and you can't place the baby carrier on the back (tandem) if your toddler wants to sit in the front instead of standing up. So I returned it.  I did some more research and decided to get Baby Trend ultra sit and stand.  I couldn't wait for shipping so I got one at Target for same price and 5% off for using their red card.I have a nearly 3 yo and an infant. My daughter flip flopping where she wants to sit (front or stand up in the back). With Joovy i couldnt put my new born on the back. Thanks god for Baby Trend that we have an option to put the baby in the front or back and the infant car seat clip onto the tray and have buckles and bar on the back to hold onto the infant carrier. I have a graco snugride 35 and it fits perfectly.  I decided to go with this Baby Trend due to the age of my kids age different. When my new born turns 1.5 or 2 to use the front seat then my toddler would be 5 who would listen better (pray to god she would).  If you have 2 kids close to age and young then you should need double stroller not tandem so they can rest.This is heavy 26 lbs but lighter than joovy (28.2lbs).  It folds up nicer than Joovy and very very sturdy made.  It took me 5 min to put take out of box and put wheels together.  That's all to it.  Overall it's better than Joovy UltraLIght and cheaper (139.99)  However I suggested before you would order from any where, go to the Target they have this new version than babiesrus and check it out by bring your kids to try out.Item steers smoothplenty of roomitem wt is averageSturdy made productlove the cups holderlove the tray that baby carrier can clips onto the trayeasy to fold/unfoldFit well in the trunk of my VW jetta (2014 where trunk is smaller than previous models)Price cheaper than other brandsEasy to assemble (5 min for me)Warning:  If you have 2 younger kids with age close to each other then better off with double stroller so they can rest.

"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I highly recommend this tub.  I have used it placed within our bathtub--I sit low to the baby and do not strain my back.  The sling was excellent to use when our son was a newborn--made bathing him a delight.  He is now 6 mos. old and sitting up--the infant side helps him to sit up without falling forward (like babies first learning to sit up tend to do), since it provides an upward slant under his legs.  As soon as he sits better, I'll move him to other side, which has the back support.  At first, I thought as a little boy, sitting on the infant side was uncomfortable (looked that way to me!) but he  loves bathtime so he must be ok.  I do not fill the tub up too much so as to make him float--and he's just fine with that--he's too busy trying to use his hands and pick up his rubber ducky.",4
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this pillow for my wife in the first trimester.  She absolutely loves this pillow.  She cannot say enough good things about it.

Gund Baby 24&quot; Comfycozy Pippy Monkey Blanket,"This review is for the lamb blanket.  I see from the other reviews on here that the monkey may not hold up well.  My almost 4-year-old son has had his lamb since he was a baby and loves it!  The texture of the fur on top is so soft that he likes to make a 'lamby pillow' at night by spreading the blanket on top of his pillow.  The lamby is a nice cross between a stuffed animal and a blanket (though is a little too small to use as an actual blanket).  It's a bit big to take places, but is a wonderful bed companion.  I've put ours through the washing and drying machines multiple times without issue.  Great gift to give or receive!",5
"Oeuf Mask and Tail Set, Zebra","My 2 year old loves dress up and adores the tigers at our local zoo, so he has had the best time with the tiger tail and nose set.

"Trend Lab Flannel Crib Sheet, Swirl Print","We wanted these for my 2 year old daughter who is infatuated with everything monkey. She had regular sheets with monkeys on them, but I had not found flannel sheets with monkeys on them.  As the weather got colder and I put the flannel sheets onto her bed (crib turned toddler bed) she got very upset and tried to take them off because I didn't have monkey flannels to put on.  When we got home from my grandparents house after my grandmother got her these sheets, and I went to put these onto her bed, I had to take off her regular monkey sheets.  My daughter was upset until she noticed that I was putting different monkey sheets on.  Her excitement was beyond explanation.I love the extra elastic bands to help secure the sheets to the bed.  In addition to the ""normal"" elastic in the edge of the sheets there is a thicker piece of elastic that goes diagonally across each corner that prevents the sheets from popping off the corners.  Not that my daughter has tried to take these sheets off her bed yet, she won't be able to if she tries.",5

"ERGObaby Organic Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Blush Beige",even if you don't use the ergo carrier this was really helpful as a barrier when putting the baby to sleep.  we put him in it while he was dozing off so that when it came time to put him in the crib he didn't feel much fingering on his skin or through his clothing so he didn't wake up from the transition.  we also used in it our moby and just as a warming layer at chilly times.,5
Aden + Anais Bamboo Crib Sheet - Azure Leafy - Aqua,"I'm a huge fan of Aden and Anais in general ... and had actually purchased their organic cotton crib sheets.  The bamboo crib sheet is that much softer, it's just wonderful. The pattern is the scratchiest part of the sheet - it's beautiful though. I'm going to buy a plain bamboo sheet.  We have washed this at least 10x by now (every other day) and it's standing up, no problems with seams or falling apart.",5
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"I bought 2 trays for my 7 and 4 y/o for a 10 day car trip. The trays are very handy and easy to clean, and the foot rest was great for the 7 y/o (4 y/o didn't even come close, we taped a shoe box to it to add height). Because of the negative reviews I told my boys over and over, BE CAREFUL!! with the trays. Well, by day 5 the 4 y/o kicked it hard enough to break it away from the base. He was able to kick it because it was pushed away from his seat while not in active use. When the tray isn't in active use, it rests in front of the seat. If you have a kicker, you'll need to stress they can't. I'd say my 4 y/o is on the ""normal"" side of the active spectrum, but he IS a 4 y/o, and if you look at the picture, it would appear that is the audience One Step Ahead is producing this for. I'm planning to try to fix it w/ my hot glue gun since it was glued in the first place, but I don't know how that'll work.Shoddy, cheap materials and workmanship, plain and simple.So, in short, the reviews are correct. This is a handy item that is great for long car trips--we spent a total of 44 hrs in the car--but buy it with the understanding that you may only get one car trip out of it. For my 4 y/o, it was half a trip. I'm giving it 3 stars rather than the 2 the quality deserves because it's a great item in theory, better than the others trays I see online.",3
Graco Mealtime Highchair Seth,"What a great highchair.  I use this daily to feed my son and I really like it!  I love the 5 point harness especially since my ds thinks he can climb out of the chair and walk on air lol. I also like the ease of cleaning the cover.  Wipe it down and put it back on, breezy!This isn't a small chair, but it folds rather compactly and can be moved with relative ease, just be sure to take the brakes off first!",4
"Blueberry Basix All in One Pocket Diaper, Medium, Cow","I ordered this Diaper in the US because it wasn't available here in Europe. It was out of order. I already have all different kinds of cloth diapers. Charlie Banana, Blueberry/Swaddlebee, TotsBots, BabyVivo, Babyland, ... My favorites are Charlie Banana and TotsBots - both dry very fast, without any dryer, within 3-4 hours. Blueberry needs longer, but they are good too. They have really nice illustrations and fit perfectly. Not so good is the very thick filling, which you can't remove.",5
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","Worked great when it worked, but stopped working after just a couple months. Just keeps giving error with every bath.",2
"Britax Car Seat Travel Cart, Black",This is a great product for traveling with small children.  It fits well with my seat.  You really need to make sure that you pull the straps very tight.  I get many compliments on this at the airport.,4
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow",This is a great toy and my son loves kicking the piano and making music. He has fun looking at himself in the mirror and playing with all the toys. It's great that I can flip the arch down for tummy time since my son has just learned how to roll over and wants to be on his tummy a lot. However my son wants to put everything in his mouth since he is teething and the toys are hard and not made to be put in his mouth. Since there are loops that the toys attach to it was easy for me to take one off and put a teether toy I had from another mat on. Luckily the teether toy I had already had the capabilities to attach to the loops. This is why I gave the review 4 stars instead of 5. Still I am very pleased and my son plays on it every day. I love that he can use this through his toddler years so it's being used for a while and not just a few months.,4
"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory","I got this tray for my baby's bumbo so we could attempt to let her play with food. She's not quite ready for a high chair, but she does sit quite well in her bumbo. It's easy to get on, but a little harder to get off. Not too much to say other than its a great bumbo accessory!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"Great for beach, outdoor festivals, park etc. wAterproof and easily to fold back into carrying case. Wish the outside pocket had a snap or Velcro to actually be functional.",5
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"I used the Brest Friend two years ago when my daughter was born, at the recommendation of a lactation consultant.  I loved it!  It worked wonderfully--much better than the Boppy.  I'm quite petite, so I particularly liked that the Brest Friend was so adjustable and could fit close to my body (my newborn would slip into the space between my body and the Boppy), and that there are bumps on the pillow that hold a newborn's head up to just the right spot.  I used it until she was several months old and wished I'd had it in the hospital when I was first trying to figure out how to nurse.  A great product!Now I'm due to have my second child, so went to wash the cover of My Brest Friend.  The zipper broke, although I'd only washed it a few times.  I called Zenoff, using the number on their web site, explained the problem, and asked where I could find a replacement cover.  Not only did they volunteer to send me a new cover free of charge, but they walked me through a description of the different covers so I could choose which one to get, and shipped out my choice immediately.  I recieved the replacement cover in 3 days.  Couldn't be better!",5
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad",This hook was supposed to be amazing. I used it once however and the foam started falling off! I am returning it. I have friends who love this thing and I was excited about the idea of it. Major fail.,1
"Red, White and Blue Vintage Aviator Airplane Plane Baby Boy Bedding 11 pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs",this bedding is adorable. quality and colors are great. the suade trim is a nice touch. this does not come with the crib bumpers which is fine with me since I will not be using them anyway.,5
Peter Potty Toddler Urinal,"Adjustable height.  It ""flushes""! The only drawback is that the collection tray is difficult to remove. It sticks or catches somewhere (and I can't figure out where) so when you pull hard enough to remove it, the water and pee sloshes resulting in spillage (yuck!) Except for that, I love it. My toddler loves it and it is small enough and light enough that you could take it with you for an extended trip.  It's not made for travel, but if you were driving to grandma's for the weekend, it would be easy to take along.  It does mount to the wall if you prefer.  The stand works just fine for us.",4
"Summer Infant Cradler, Ivory","Love this item.  Keeps my baby's head from getting jerked from side to side, and neck stays straight while he naps.  Also, nice cool materials keep baby from overheating (even while traveling to Arizona!), unlike a lot of U-shaped support pillows.  Fully adjustable, grows with baby.  Stays in place.  Never again will I have to deal with rolled up blankets to support baby's head and neck.  This is much more convenient, works better, and is much safer.  Every baby needs one.",5
Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White,"This is not a toy, but so far the pillow is amazing. I have had it for almost two months and I love it. I have issues with using mulitpule pillows when I sleep, they always tend to fall whenever I toss and turn. My husband bought me this pillow as a gift after he got tired of me using him to rest my legs on at night. I did have a small issue with the top of the pillow bing too full. I am 5'8"" and I have no issue with the pillow being too tight around my body. The pillow works with me on nights when it takes me a while to fall asleep. After I am out though, I only find myself waking up to go to the bathroom, something that is unavoidable during pregnancey. I sleep more soundly than before with the pressure taken off my back. I would highly recommend this product to everyone pregnant or not.",4

"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have tried just about every baby bottle! I avoided Born Free because of the cost and the additional parts (the valve system)I should have just gone to them from the beginning. These are the only bottles that don't leak- in 5 months of use I haven't had a single leak- not like Avent, where I was constantly covered in formula!You can save some money on the nipples- Dr. Brown wide bottles are the same nipple.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","My wife kept wanting a BOB and mentioning it to me again and again.  We had initially settled for a cheaper stroller, and then we were hoping to find a bargain on one of these on clist or get lucky on a garage sale, but we never found any secondhand.  Now I know why!  I don't think you'd ever part with this.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","This is an incredible buy. The price on Amazon is lower than anywhere else I've looked around.The seat is comfy and easy to secure. Like some of the reviews here, I didn't think threading it was that big of a deal. The selling part for us was the high safety rating this carseat got.We got this in the matrix fabric, which is not the plushiest of them all, so if that's a concern, get a more expensive color with the plushy seats. To us this one is comfortable and does the job well.",5
Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Pink,"Love the spoon, super handy.  My baby loves it too.  My only compliant is that the spoon is too deep where my baby can't get all of the food out of the bottom of the spoon on her own.  I have to slide the spoon on her lip to get all of the food off.  Would buy it again.",4
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Brown Mod Circles, Pastel Pink","Finally, a swaddling blanket that's modern, large, and well made. I highly recommend it! I have 2 for my son and have bought several as gifts. Everyone seems to love it.",5

Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"I bought this for my one-year old daughter after reading most of the reviews already posted.  Since most of the negative reviews were written a while ago, I was hoping that the problems others experienced were fixed.  Unfortunately, this was not so.  After three uses, the pump died.  My husband (who is an electrical engineer) could not fix it so we trashed the base.  Granted, she can still play with the boats, but they do tend to tip over and sink to the bottom of the tub.  It is a shame, my daughter loved it for the brief time it was working.",1
mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go,"I purchased this for a trip we were taking with our 6 month old to avoid packing the sleep sheep we were given when he was born, and I must say, I was impressed. True it doesn't get quite as loud as the sleep sheep but the volume seems very adequate to me. I like how it can either be on a timer or can run continuoulsy until you turn it off (this continuous opperation is not an option on the sleep sheep -its timer only goes up to 45 mins). It uses 3 AAA batteris and those will last about a week running continuously at night about 8-10 hrs. It's compact and easy to use for travel. I could also easly be clipped onto a car seat for use in the car as well. We primarily use the ""ocean"" feature and it sounds ok. My husband can hear the track repeating but I have to listen pretty carefully to catch it. Overall an excellent purchase for the money.",4
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,"We bought this seat because my son potty trained at 13 months.  He was too small not to fall into toilets at that age, and it was just too difficult for me to somehow hold him AND him be comfortable going AND then be able to wipe him if necessary.  At home we have a padded toilet insert that he loves, and our other toilet has a flip-down kids seat that's fantastic.This fold-up seat is small and easy to take with us everywhere.  He calls it ""my special seat"" and will use any toilet, anywhere.  This even included a scary black toilet we saw once that he didn't want to get near, until I put his special seat on top.  He used the toilet.  When he was washing his hands, a 3-yr-old boy and his mother came into the restroom... and I overheard the boy outright refuse to use the toilet because it was scary.  They ended up leaving the bathroom with the mom reminding him not to pee in his underwear.Anyhow, my son is now 2.5 years old.  We still use this seat when we're out.  He's never once fallen or slipped.  He feels very secure on this seat.  There was a little bit of a trick to getting used to it back when we first got it - I set the seat at the very FRONT of the toilet, then push it back until the front lip of this travel seat lines up with the front lip of the toilet seat.  Then I left him up onto it.The only down side is that it's not as stable as our home seats, and now that he's older he can go without our help at home, but he still needs us to lift him up and put him on the toilet when we travel.I think they should install a child's urinal in every womens room for when boys are with their moms.  Public toilets are too tall for him to pee standing, so we're stuck using this travel seat until his legs get longer.  When he's with my husband, he can go in the urinals so they don't have to lug this silly seat everywhere.  Now that he's older and larger on the seat, we have to be diligent with ""point it down"" so that he doesn't pee on the front rim of the toilet or on the floor or his pants while sitting.  I doubt that would be an issue with a girl, though, and the seat works perfect when he needs to poop.  It's even plenty stable when he leans forward to wipe.",5
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","These don't leak, are easy to clean, and the perfect size for meals.  I had the bigger gerber sippies but my Dr thinks my kids are drinking too much and gaining weight.  perfect portion control.",5
Koala Baby 4 Pack Receiving Blankets - Boy Assortment,"I bought these receiving blankets when my son was first born back in November. I used them to swaddle him for almost a month.  These blankets are very good size.  After the first month, I cannot swaddle him anymore because he's an ""escape artist"" who always manage to get one of his arm or leg out side of the blankets. The blankets held up well after washes.  Now the weather are getting warmer.  I'm using them as light blankets for warm nights.  They are excellent.  Definitely worth the money.",5
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","This is my first and only video baby monitor.The good:Excellent live color video qualityOutstanding night vision capabilityAudio-only mode (saves battery)Auto-shutoff during inactivity (saves battery)Auto-on when it detects sound and/or motionInternal batteries so you can take the monitor with you via included belt-clipBattery can last a day without charging (depending on use/activity in room)Intercom function allows you to talk to your childMusical lullabies play through the camera, activated by the parent via a button on the monitor, to help the child fall asleep (5 different tunes to choose from)Night-light built into the camera to provide a soft illumination in your child's roomThe bad:Poor mounting design on camera.  Not easy to mount onto wall due to its inability to bend at a 90 degree angle.  Seems like ceiling mounting is best option (but then video is upside-down).The monitor itself is thin, and doesn't stand on its own very well.  It's constantly falling over at the slightest of movement.  The best way to store it on a table is screen-side down, but then you can't see the video!The musical lullabies stay on until you turn them off.  It would be nice to have a 5-min or 10-min timer on the lullabies.Short range - only about 100 ft line of sight.  If you have walls, expect to reduce that range by about 20 ft per wall.  We have our kid on the 2nd floor of our house and we can't get a signal from our basement, about 30 ft directly below her room.The ugly:When the lullabies are playing, it's the only thing that you can hear through the monitor.  Therefore, the screen would always be on and the sound-sensors constantly going off.  This causes the battery on the monitor to fun out much quicker (about 2 hrs).This also causes another problem - if you use the lullaby to help your child go to sleep, all you can hear is the lullaby - you can't hear little grunts, groans, or anything other than a full-out cry (and even then it's hard to hear) because the lullabies are so loud coming out of the monitor.  This is because the mic on the camera is only about 1 inch from the speaker.I would recommend not even introducing the fact that the lullabies play through the camera - just use the child's favorite stuffed animal, music box, or other means to help it fall asleep.  Once the kid learns these lullabies exist, they will expect to hear them while sleeping, and it will reduce the usefulness of the monitor.I don't use the lullabies anymore, and I never used the zoom functions.  The night light offers the perfect amount of light, and the monitor's auto-on and off features are pretty good.  If you want to spend more money, you can get additional cameras (i'm thinking about getting a second one), and the monitor has the ability to scroll through each monitor one-by-one.  I can't speak to how well this feature works.  All in all, I think this is a great baby monitoring system.",5

"OXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green","It's the dumbest thing because it's just a spoon, but it does make it easier for a newbie like me to feed my baby his first solids!  The shape is just right to aim it right in, then alley-oop up out of the mouth, depositing the food to the back of baby's tongue and scraping the remainder off as you slide it up and out of baby's mouth.  Feeding is less messy and much more productive.  And, it's very soft for baby to gum or chew.  I was using the Munchkin spoons, but these just work better (and the Munchkin ones have kind of a sharp edge around the bowl that I was concerned may cut my baby's gums).",5
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,This is a very cute toddler plate & utensil set. It's very durable and the colors are bright. I definitely recommend this product.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish","I've been using this gate in a 68"" opening, and it is perfect. It's strong, doesn't bow or shake. Other reviewers mentioned that the max length is achieved by having bolts stick way out of the wall - at 68"", the bolts are very short.The latch at the top of the gate has been worn loose by me tugging upward at the gate without pushing the button first. If you dislike the latch like I did, be aware that you can wear it out!Installation was a two-person job, but straight-forward.",5

We have two (one in the crib, one in the wash kind of thing) and they both look so worn already. He loves to chew on them and they are so ratty and no matter how much you wash them they still don't smell fresh! I would love to just buy him two new ones and get rid of the old ones but at $24 each that's not going to happen. I wish that I had bought him a cheap lovey in the beginning as most of my friends did and they just replace them every few months at a fraction of the cost. If they halved the price I would give this 5 stars and keep buying them!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been nursing and am now switching our daughter to abottle.  We've tried several different bottles and these were the ones my daughter will take.

"Blueberry Coveralls Diaper Cover Snap, Butterflies",i've used imse vimse covers over the years and chose them over my experience with thirsties and bummis. but i recently got these and cannot say enough great things. mine says blueberry on it - it looks like swaddlebees (another name?) - this diaper cover is just amazing. it stands up to washing and drying and it fits well and protects well (your little one and his/her clothes or bedding). i've tried many diaper covers and all-in-ones. i like to use these the most out of my entire stash.,5
36 x 20 Bedrail,"I bought 2 of these rails (in white) and the instructions do say to be used with a matress & boxspring. I had to use commonsense to install it since the instructions are of no real help. We have a twin size bed with a high matress for our 2 yrs. The square bar is just below the top of the matress so that it does not touch her when she's sleeping. She's been taking her naps in her bed and no roll overs or falling out. So far so good. The only con is the instructions. It does not say how to fold it down. I got it by looking at the image. When you have the lower bar set to unlock,each of the hidged bars have arrows on it. Pull them up at the same time and voila! it folds down! Sorry if my comment is long but I want to give out as much info for those who are thinking about buying it, especially those that cannot figure out how to fold it down.",4
"The First Years True Fit SI C680 Car Seat, Naturalization","Easy to install and apparently comfortable.  This is the second The First Years convertible car seat that we bought and it is just as easy to install as the first one was.  I am not sure why people think this is a difficult install...all you have to do is attach the latches to the anchors, put all your weight into the seat and tighten that puppy down.  Installed in less than 2 minutes.  Just like the first seat.As our second daughter is 9 months old, she is still rear facing.  The seat does take up a lot of room that way.  We have this in an Explorer and my wife is pretty uncomfortable driving but since it is only for 3 months she is dealing with it.  The reason for this is we needed to install the top headrest which is pushing the overall footprint for this car seat even further into the front seat.  If you have a smaller car, this may be an issue (just a word of warning).  I would not not purchase this seat because of that though.Our daughter seems to love this seat and as a ton of room to stretch out.  Prior to getting  this seat she would rarely sleep in the car...now she is out within 2 minutes.",5

Baby Bee-Haven Swing n' Smart,"I have to admit when my mom bought this for me I didn't understand what a great gift it was.  My daughter is 10 months old and we just started putting her in the bucket swings in the park two months ago.  She LOVES THEM. Its getting cold now in Colorado but on a crisp day I still take her for some fresh air.  She is always pointing at the swings, I was worried about the cold seat and her hands getting cold on the chain but then I remembered I had this Swingen Smart. Brilliant!  I will not leave home without it all winter.I know its supposed to be protection against germs but for me that is just an added plus.  This is going to allow my daughter to swing happily all winter long.",5
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"This monitor was the best we've tried(in the end-4 bought &amp; 3 returned) It is very clear- as it's name points out. The pros- very clear,both units are slim-not bulky like nost, baby's unit stands up or lays flat, comes WITH rechargable batteries,doesn't pick up much outside noise. My biggest problem is that if the parent &amp; baby units are too close, espically with the parent unit on a high setting, they both give a shreaking noise- but that can easily be avoided.",5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I purchased the extra tall pressure mounted gate because of the increased height, auto close feature, multi-directional swing and simple installation.

"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Jemma","I spend hours, over many days trying to pick out the best car seat for my daughter after outgrowing her Graco 30. I really love the concept of this seat. I will never have to buy another car seat EVER. The expiration date on these is a long time. We first purchased the Britax Marathon 70. It is nice with its padded straps and crotch snap. I didn't like how her feat already touched the back of the seat. I know they say kids don't mind, but I do. It looks terribly uncomfortable at a certain point and we plan to rear face for a while. That brings me to another point. I was told that the shell of this is the same height as the Britax but I don't really think that is true. I'm not an expert in car seats, but this one looks much taller than the Britax. One con I had heard about this seat is that it is so big and heavy. It is heavy because it is reinforced with steel. A steel reinforced car seat was a must for us. Although the car seat crash tests are not released we will never know of these more expensive seats are safer. I do believe steel is much safer than plastic. My older daughter had a plastic car seat and it was so flimsy. It even cracked in 1 year of use. Ok, back to the things I love. I love how much it reclines. I do not like seeing my daughters head flopped over. It is so easy to buckle. I'm used to graco, and the Graco 30 was a pain to unbuckle. This one is much easier. It also has a pad around the crotch, so you don't have to go digging for the crotch snap. As far as my knowledge is, this is the only convertable car seat on a base. So you can buy an additional base for another car. The price on this seat has gotten even better. It is such a great buy. I would buy it again in a New York minute if we needed another car seat.",5
Bugaboo Cameleon Adapter for Select Maxi-Cosi Car Seats,"I read all the reviews and was nervous about using this product.  What if I couldn't get these adapters off and ended up stuck somewhere with a crying baby???  Nightmare, right?  But it was too difficult for my husband and me to transfer our baby out of the car seat each time, not to mention we'd wake her up.  So I decided to ordered this and tested them at home several times before venturing out with them.  Here are some tips to getting them to work properly:1.  Right and left are the opposite of your right and left as others have mentioned.,2.  Use your foot to step down on the tire or other part of the stroller, push the grey button on the car seat, and use both hands to pull one side of the car seat off the adapter at a time.  I know, that's totally crazy and you shouldn't have to do this but it does work!3.  When installing the adapters make sure the white latch is engaged.  It needs to be flush with the black part of the adapter.  If it is not that means the latch is not locked and you need to manually move the white latch over.  If it won't move over double check that the ""prongs"" or ""teeth"" on the bottom have been inserted properly.  Once it's correctly in you can move the white latch or lock over to engage.4.  After you use this item... I don't know... maybe about 50 times or so it will ""loosen"" and get easier to remove from the stroller.  The first dozen or so times I really really struggled but now not so much (granted you still have to work at it and that will probably never change even after a thousand uses.  Just poor design.)If you already have the maxi-cosi car seat and the bugaboo stroller and really have no other option to change either car seat or stroller I would recommend buying these adapters.  Yes, they are a huge pain but they do work.  It is way better than not having them and once you get used to working them you will be happy you bought them.  Note to bugaboo: Redesign this item, please!  Esp given the high cost and consistent trouble users report.",3
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"My son got this from his grand-parents for Christmas a few months ago.  Contrary to the ""professional"" people who leave comments to scare people away and make others feel like they are bad parents, this saucer is wonderful.  Lots of little things to catch a childs eye, and many things for them to play with.  My son is 6 months old and I will place him in the saucer for a quick shower or so I can start dinner.  I don't recommend getting one of these and keeping your child in it all day long, but for when you need a minute this is great.  Very sturdy and it also scrunches down for easy storage.  My father-in law researched quite a few, and I will admit I was against the exer-saucers at first.  However, when I actually became a parent to a very high-maintenance child...this tends to give me a minute if needed and gives my son a little recess time of his own.",5
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Ordered this gate and it was here in two days!!!  It was super easy to install...did it by myself!  :-). Dogs are not afraid to go in and out of it when open which is a plus since one of my dogs is a little timid.  I purchased this gate to keep them out of my bedroom at night because they were keeping me awake getting in and out of bed.  They are still able to see me, but they can't hog my bed anymore.  Works like a dream.  I have read reviews about the tension mounting being wobbly but we have ours up that way and it is very sturdy.  My 5 year old is able to open it to come in and out which is good for me since he isn't the one I'm trying to keep out.  Seems like a good product to me!",5
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss 2 Piece Pajama Set, Green/Yellow, 12 Months","I ordered 2 other pairs of these pajamas they came straight from amazon they got here sooner with free shipping. I want a few days longer for this pair and the shipping cost from the store was stunning. the pjs. where 14.95 and the cost of this one pair was over 8.00 that is a very big turn off. I could have bought another pair of pjs. If it had came overnight that would be different. I was pleased with the pajamas in every other way. but I would never by straight from this seller again. I got ripped off. Thanks and I hope you look into how much you charge for shipping. They where one pair of tiny baby pajamas. Thanks, Diana",4

I use it throughout the day but it's especially helpful at night and when someone else is watching baby (no need to ask me when last diaper change or feeding was).The nightlight feature is handy too because it shuts off on it's own.The only improvement to this simple gadget would be to add a function that keeps track of how many total feedings in a day.",4

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"I know this product my sound gross, but it really works. Granted the first time you use it you may gag, but the results make it well worth it. I tried sucking my babies nose out with a nasal aspirator and it never seemed to get it all. The Nosefrida creates a seal that helps to get more stuff out of your child's nose. The filter keeps any of it from getting to you, but I never had it suck up that far. The Nosefrida also comes apart for easy cleaning.",5
Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g),"I found out about this product last summer when my 18 month old had diarrhea on and off for over three months. When none of the other major brands worked, I resorted to anti-fungal creams; however, those did not work, so I kept searching. The Lansinoh cream was the only thing I could find that would help heal severe diaper rash. I don't use it as an everyday barrier (due to the price), but I keep it around in case my babies start to develop a rash. Definitely worth the price, but hard to find in stores...I order it on Amazon (wish they'd make it Prime eligible).",5

The first day I received the Sleepsuit I tried it that night and like magic she fell asleep. I was able to put her in her crib and she slept there all night from 9pm until 7am the next morning! She even woke up with the biggest smile on her face. I've used it every night since, wash it regularly, and still works like magic!!",5

"Maclaren Easy Traveller Stroller, Black and Silver","I had a travel system with my first child but hated to use it because it was so bulky, once he was of an age to use them I generally took cheap umbrella strollers everywhere.  When he was 2 his legs were too long for the umbrella strollers but he still needed a stroller for trips and long outings.  I invested in the Maclaren Volo, an 8 lb. umbrella stroller and absolutely loved it.  Since the stroller part of our travel system broke I went in search of a infant stroller to get through the first 6 months with our new baby until it is big enough to ride in the Volo.  I was overjoyed when I found this car seat carrier by Maclaren.  It is a brand I really like and my old infant car seat fits easily.  It was slightly wider and larger than I expected (11 lbs.)but folds up to about the size of an umbrella stroller when not in use.  Can't wait for the baby to arrive and take long walks with our new stroller.",5

Our SkipHop Diaper Kit is far superior in terms of design.  It has all the same parts including the wipe case but once you fill it the kit still closes!

"Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat, Mystique","I purchased this car seat online through BRUS about a month ago and have the Gemni (purple) color. It was all that was available and even though I have a boy it's a very deep purple and not ""girlie"".I have very similar sentiments as the first reviewer. Prior to buying this one I bought and tested the Radian Diono, SafetyFirst Air (65), Britax Pavilion and Recaro ProRide. This car seat was my absolute favorite (The Recaro ProRide was up there except it's latch anchor belt is surprisingly/ridiculously too short and I could not install it into my 2008 Hyundai Tuscan, a compact SUV. I had no problem installing any of the other car seats with the latch anchor system so the Recaro was completely out of the running, which was a bummer because it did seem very nice). Right now we are using it rear-facing for my 9-month old who recently grew out of his Chicco Keyfit. He is approximately 28 inches tall and 19 lbs. (his head in the infant seat while sitting was more than an inch from the edge). We have successfully installed it into a 2008 Hyundai Tuscan, a 2003 Toyota Highlander and a conversion van (no clue the make/model or year but it didn't have latch anchors).Ease of Installation and Tight Fit - **********(10/5)Installation is the easiest of all of the convertible carseats we tried tried. Well...with the latch anchor that is. We transferred into a van that didn't have anchors and spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to use the seatbelt to install. The photos on the car seat didn't help at all. Maybe it's just us, but we aren't dumb people and my husband eventually had to look up a video online in order to figure it out (there isn't actually a video that shows how to do it rear-facing either, only forward-facing but we finally figured it out.) The numbered base is awesome (neither of us were comfortable using a pool noodle or towel to secure a car seat), and makes it SO easy to change the angle. It kind of makes you wonder why this wasn't done by any other car seat company ever before. The bubble level - also ingenious, I mean really, why no other car seat company puts one on their car seats is beyond me. Being able to VISUALLY see instantly whether or not your car seat is installed properly so you can quickly and easily make the adjustment could mean the difference of life or death of your child. Again, not sure why every car seat out there isn't equipped with better visual indicators. The latch system allows you to get a TIGHT fit in less than a minute. Shake the car seat and it doesn't move. It was the absolute tightest fit we got with the least amount of time effort of all the car seats we tested. For installation ease and fit this car seat gets 10 stars!Size - ****.* (4.5/5)The first car seat I tried was the Radian Diono because it goes up to 120 lbs. forward facing and I wouldn't need to buy another car seat. The problem with that concept, however, for us was that the passenger seat had to be moved all the way forward in order to get it to fit (we have it installed behind the passenger seat). This would obviously be an even greater issue as we add additional car seats and we can't push the driver seat up much. The Britax Pavilion and Safety First were also too long when we tried to get the angle right. The NextFit and ProRide were the only two that fit nicely behind the passenger seat without having to move the seat up too much. What I like better about the KeyFit though is that the side protectors aren't as huge as the ProRide and my child can still see out the window. He is still getting the side impact protection without sacrificing his view. The Radian was the easiest car seat to get my child into and out of from a spacing standpoint. The ProRide was pretty tight and he's only 9 months old. SafetyFirst was decent as is the KeyFit. The sides of the carseat come up a bit more than some of the others (it's a bit wider) but I still have ample space to get my son in and out without banging his head on the car. Like I said, it is a bit wider so there is no way you could get more than 2 car seats in your back seat and I'm not sure you could fit a third person along with the two car seats (Recaro ProRide boasts fitting 3 across the back) so if you need that option the KeyFit might not be your car seat. In comparing the size, sturdiness, weight (it's heavy - in a good way - but not crazy heavy if you are transferring often, it's manage) to the others I think they KeyFit is among the best. I think an easy addition for Chicco is a small handle of some sort on the back to make transporting it easier. There's really not much you can grab onto towards the top/back, which forces you to sort of wrap your whole arms around it to lift it. I'd love a small handle/grip area to just pick it up with one hand. For that I give this area 4.5 stars.Height Adjustable Harness (no need to re-thread, just pull up/push down) - **** (4/5)I love this feature! It allows you to get the best possible fit for your child in his/her seat very quickly without taking anything apart and re-threading. Other convertible car seats have this ability to easily move the straps up and down (SafetyFirst Air was a button too, and the Recaro ProRide has a circular crank you turn on both sides) but not as great as the Nextfit. SafetyFirst Air wouldn't go low enough and my son's head didn't even come close to the side protectors. The NexFit slide goes down nice and low. The slide however, is sticky, and definitely doesn't slide as easily as the SafetyFirst or Recaro, but I'm hoping it's just because it's new and needs a little movement. Though at this price point and from Chicco I would expect it to work flawlessly. So it only gets 4 stars.Padding/Comfort - (Pending) ****.* (4.5/5)The padding is great in this car seat. Going from the KeyFit where you could feel the plastic through the padding, Chicco really stepped it up with the NextFit. It is plush and has almost a memory foam feel. The only concern I have (as other reviewers do) is the breathability of it, especially during the summer. We are still experiencing snow here in May (lovely MN) but had 2 days of 70 degree weather and when I pulled my son out of the car seat after an hour long car ride he was wet on his back and the back of his head. This is a bit concerning to me as we had the air on and I was even a little chilly in the car. I am definitely concerned about how it will perform on long road trips so I would warn buyers to test this during warm weather if possible. I will not hesitate to return this car seat if it is going to make my son sweaty and uncomfortable. Because of this I can only give this area 4 stars right now instead of 5. (I will update once I can test this better). However, the material is easy enough to wipe down, which is also important so I'll bump it up to 4.5 stars.Harness/Straps - * (1/5) UPDATE **** (3.5/5)UGH. This is the ONLY thing I hate about the car seat. We were coming from the KeyFit and the NextFit is pretty much identical as far as the tightening system goes. Only it takes WAY too much effort to get it snug - and nearly impossible to get it tight. I think a lot of it has to do with some sort of design flaw when the seat is actually installed and the child is sitting in the seat. Because sitting on the floor in our living room we can tighten and loosen that thing super easily. But once it's installed, you're trying to pull the strap back toward your child, not down, but the strap is wedged between the seat and the carseat and it is SO hard to budge (we did notice you have to make sure the headrest of the seat in front is not touching the car seat because the belt goes through the back and is exposed so if it's touching and pushing on it, that can prevent you from being able to tighten the strap). Even after we noticed that though the strap is STILL very hard to tighten. I think the shoulder pads might be getting in the way too, it's hard to tell. I hate the size of the shoulder pads. They are WAY too big for my son and I cannot remove them. That is a BIG fail to me. When I buckle him in and push the plastic buckle part up so it is across his chest in the right spot the shoulder pads overlap onto the buckle and are so long they touch the back of the car seat. If I could remove them perhaps we could get a tighter fit and as he gets bigger I am hoping this is no longer an issue. Right now I have to yank and yank and yank and yank to get it as tight as I can and it still doesn't feel or look tight enough. It's also impossible to do the pinch test because of the shoulder pads. That also annoys me. Chicco did SO well on everything else, it saddens me that this important aspect was the worst out of all the car seats I tested. Don't judge by playing with it at the store. You have to install it and put your kid in and test it out before you can get a sense for the difficulty of this. This was actually the reason I ordered the Recaro ProRide (which didn't end up fitting in my car or it may have replaced the KeyFit). The only redeeming quality of the harness/straps system is that there are two different buckle points for rear-facing vs. forward-facing. I'm not really sure how big of deal this is, but if it truly does provide added safety I think that it is a really great feature. That earns this area 1 single star.UPDATE: I moved the head part up and was able to tighten the harness MUCH easier! Super happy about that. The shoulder straps are still annoying so I will bump this part up to a 3.5. I still think this should still be easier and none of the other of the other car seats I tested were this difficult. I think some re-design/tweaking here could make the KeyFit really blow all the other convertible car seats in its class out of the water. I mean, simply having removable shoulder pads would be huge!Despite the issues with tightening, this is still my favorite car seat out of all of the ones we tested. There are so many great things about it and I am still working on troubleshooting the harness/straps because I truly think it's something that is fixable. I've been in contact with Chicco customer service and am just trying to coordinate a time/date I can be on the phone with them while my son is strapped in and patient enough to let us troubleshoot it.I'm not sure why it took Chicco this long to come out with a convertible car seat but I'd like to think it was because they were really fine-tuning a really awesome concept that is among the best out there. With so many out there at so many different price points it can be hard to decide. This car seat is by far the easiest to use (of the ones we tested) with the most features that ensure and VISIBLY show the safety and security of my child so I know I'm putting him in safely every time. Nothing against people who use pool noodles or towels to get the right angle...I just think if I am spending that much money on something it should come with everything I need to get the right fit. I don't ever want to have to ""guess"" if my child's car seat is installed correctly or he's strapped in correctly or angled correctly. Chicco takes the guesswork out of everything so you can transport your child with confidence and peace of mind every time.Gosh, I sound like an infomercial. Lol.I hope this helps though!:)UPDATE: Okay, so I figured out I had threaded the Recaro ProRide latch belt through the forward facing area and there is a different rear-facing area (so when I previously said I wasn't dumb...I may need to retract that statement). I still have the car seat so I tried it again and sure enough it fit! However because the back seats in my SUV slant back somewhat, there was still a gap where the base didn't meet the seat when I tilted the car seat back to have the line parallel to the seat...I tried for 20 minutes to get it installed tightly without having to put anything in that gap and finally gave up and decided to stick with the Chicco KeyFit. The ProRide would definitely be my second choice though. The button to release the belt that tightens the harness is a bit more hidden and harder to access than the KeyFit (though super easy to tighten) and some of the foam from the padding is exposed near the crotch belt, which makes me nervous with dirt/food/spills. Those are things I could live with, however not being able to easily get the right seat angle isn't. I think this would be an awesome forward facing seat. The ProRide's material seemed more breathable than the KeyFit but we will see...summer needs to reach us here first in MNUPDATE 1/16/14: Just adding another update as we've now had the carseat(s) for almost 10 months. Just want to say that I've noticed something important that affects my ability to tighten the straps - the air temperature. We have hit some record lows here in MN this winter (-45 with the wind chill) and if I do not have my car warmed up before I put my son in it, it is SO very difficult to tighten the straps. I didn't consider this before with my review because I didn't think about that being a factor, but it absolutely is. Once the car is warmer though the straps move much more easily. So I'm not sure this is a design flaw...but this is still my only complaint about the carseat. The straps are still annoying but I don't notice them as much now that he's bigger. We've also gotten a minivan (Honda Odyssey) that we now have this carseat in (second baby on the way) and it was just as easy to install and fits wonderfully. My son is nearly 18 months old now and around 28 lbs. and 32"" tall, which is considered average for height and weight (he's a little rounder than he is tall though). He still fits very easily and comfortably into this carseat rear-facing. I can definitely see us being able to keep him rear-facing until he is 2. Right now his feet don't even touch the seat because the carseat is angled back and he sits in it fairly deeply. I'm very happy that I can continue to keep him comfortably rear-facing in this seat as I've had many friends turn their kids forward because their kids became uncomfortable in their carseat rear-facing. So if that is important to you and your child is ""averageish"" percentile (or lower) for height and weight you will probably be able to keep them rear-facing until 2. I will post another update though once he's 2 and verify that we were able to do this.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Tan","Fits perfectly in my car and my hubby's. We got extra bases, one for Daddy's car and one for Grandma's.

Purple Woogie Fee Plush Kid Case for iPhone and iPod touch,My daughter got one for her birthday and so I had to test this thing out lol. It has so many uses so it will definitely pay for itself in the long run. I watch kids a lot and let's face it technology has become part of our lil one's lives. I have tons of movies on my phone so this works well with kids holding it cause they drop things. It is soft and plush yet firm enough to sit in pretty much any position on your lap. I know some people complain about the plastic screen but if you are watching a movie your screen isn't hard to see. Now playing a game it's awkward to hold. This woogie comes with an app you can download that has a face that matches your woogie. Your toddler might like the face cause you can poke it shake it tickle it and the woogie laughs and says things. You can also take woogie on adventures in the app so the older kids can play too might have to take the phone out to play some games but all in all good product.  I have a galaxy s4 and it fits great. Only one thing I wish this product has was a spot to put headphones. Oh and if you don't put it in or take it out your toddler won't figure it out so fast lol.,5

"Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38","I originally bought 3 Naturepedic waterproof portacrib pads to use in play yards & their bassinets, and as my children grew, have added crib & twin sized pads, and discovered that 3 portacrib pads, slightly overlapping, will perfectly cover a twin sized bed. On a twin bed, usually only 1 of the 3 pads will get wet at a time, but even on the rare occassion that all 3 get soaked, 3 small pads seem to fit in the washer easier than one big twin-sized pad.  My original 3 pads are still in great shape after several years of use with multiple refluxers & diaper soak-thrus, and machine wash & dry.  With a growing family, I ordered an additional set of portacrib pads which are thinner, softer, and more flexible than the originals, but seem to hold up to overnight soakings just fine.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Just what was needed to bring my grandson into his &#34;big boy bed&#34; from a crib/day bed.Very colorful and cheerful.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"My daughter absolutely adores her play mat. She likes the hanging toys and the music. I like the baby initiated music feature. She kicks the bar or pulls a toy and the music starts again, keeping her interested. There are plenty of attachments, so we have attached our own toys as well, and there is plenty of options for play time. The mat also has little tabs and a crinkle leaf to make tummy time more interesting. The only complaint I have is the mirror toy, which as another reviewer mentioned hangs in such a manner that baby can't really see herself in the mirror. Overall I am very happy with the toy, and it is definitely my daughter's favorite.",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Love how it's so easy to attach to almost any infant seat and they love the sounds colors and movement.,5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"I purchased this gym for our first son. He loves it!  When doing research this gym had the best dangling toys and many extra hooks for adding our own toys. The dangling toys are interesting (see through rattles, bells, mirror, squeaks, etc) and high quality.  The toys also have size appropriate features to help their fine motor skills, wooden rings to grab, small orange feet to pinch.Also the base mat is interesting with a built in mirror. This made tummy time more fun which helped him stay on tummy longer. When we just put him on a blanket he cried sooner therefore shortening overall time. He was rolling front to back at 3 months repeatedly and I credit this gym a lot. (When you put him on belly, put the toys up over the support so they don't hit his head)Only thing I'd add is more interactive play on the mat. It does have a squeaker, some crinkly leaves but I would love something that would make music or noise when he kicks.We started using this at about 2-weeks old and still use it extensively at 4-month!",4
The First Years All Purpose Steam Sterilizer,"I use the Playtex Drop-Ins bottle system to feed my baby, so I needed a better and safer alternative than boiling to sterilize the nipples and such.I chose this particular steam sterilizer, since it seemed to be the easiest to use, it got good reviews and would work for what I needed it for.I like this a lot, it saves time and sterilizes like it's supposed to.The things that I don't like is that it's not large enough to fit the bottles (I thought it was a lot larger and was kind of disappointed at how small it was when it arrived), only the caps, nipples, closing rings, pacifiers and other small items. It doesn't have a drying feature, so like with boiling, I have to wait till everything cools down and air drys before I can use anything.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I highly recommend this baby toy to every parent. Both of my children have loved Jacques the Peacock and I always buy this toy for expectant parents/baby shower gift. There are so many cool & stimulating features of this toy including the mirror and the bright colors. Enjoy!,5
"Stork Craft Bradford 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib Changer, Espresso","really like the look and quality of this crib/changer. we got the white one - its all solid wood and feels really sturdy and high quality, which feels like a score for the price.  when i first looked at the assembly directions i panicked, but i was determined to do it (at 35 weeks pregnant!) and it wasn't so bad. it took me about 4 hours by myself. helps to have an electric drill. the only think i will say is that the box looked like it fell of the back of a truck when it arrived. it was all torn up and the styrofoam inside was all broken and shredded. miraculously all the parts were fine though.  the drawers and back shelves offer really nice extra storage options.",5
Safety 1st 36 Pack Secure Press Plug Protectors,"My 2 year old twins can pull these out very easily. I caught them pulling them out and trying to plug in an electrical cord. They are looser in the plug than most brands, and the little 'button' you push to make it easy to be removed by adults can be pushed by a child. I am replacing ours.... these should be recalled.",1
"Boon Water Bugs Floating Bath Toys with Net,Orange",I bought this for my one year old and he loves it.  Great for the pool or bath.  I would recommend this toy.,4
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I bought this blanket for a friend who is having a little girl.  This is now my ""go to"" shower gift!  I bought one for my 5 week old son who was only sleeping 2 hours at a time.  As soon as I started swaddling him in the miracle blanket, his sleep increased to 4-5 hours at a time!  He's 4 months old now & we're still using the blanket.  In fact, when he sees it, he starts smiling!  He loves getting wrapped up at night.  Once I wrap him, he falls asleep in 5-10 minutes.  This is a must have for babies that have difficulity sleeping.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I have 3-4 different ones around the house and this is my favorite so far. Like the locking mechanism, just a good product.",5
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",We love this chair! It is super easy to put on and take off but is also very secure. Our little guy is still a little small for it (but desperately wants to be part of the action) so we just stuff a blanket around him. It folds up so it is fairly easy to travel with. The fabric is a sturdy material. I haven't had to clean it yet.,5
"Delta 30 Count Set of Kids Velvet Hanger, Pink","I ordered these hangers to go in addition with the delta nursey organizer.  They are the perfect size for my toddlers clothes and I love the velvet material.  They help avoid from the clothes slipping off easily.The hanges themselves are great, but receiving them was a hassle.  There is apparently some confusion on Amazon's (Packaging) end as I only received 1 pack of 10 hangers when ordered them.  I had to order them 3 times and request a refund/credit for the two additional orders just to get the advertised 30 hangers.  (I confirmed on other retailers website that this indeed IS suppose to be a 30 pack and Amazon confirmed thats what their records indicate).",4
"Stork Craft Metal Glider and Ottoman, Black/Beige","I owned this chair well over a 1.5 years. We actually just replaced it, and yes we replaced it with a differnet glider.There were some major pluses, but there were also some draw backs.Pluses:I loved the pockets on the sides.The fabric was so easy to clean (just wipe it down).The recline was awesome, as was the swivle.It was so comfortable. The armrest were at the perfect height to help support my baby's weight.It was also very easy to rock.Minuses:I did not like how much space it took up (that base is huge).I hated the squeaking. It didn't matter how much WD-40 I put on it, it squeaked. I think (if I remember right) the squeaking started about 7/8 months after we got it.Then the kicker was when it broke. There is a post that concets the base to the chair. The post snaped, so for a few days we lived with a wobbly chair. When we moved it to replace it, it fell apart.For the amount I spent on it I expected it to last longer.",3

"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","Captivating. Very versitile play for baby. The little tiger comes off and can travel with you, which is nice. The music is catchy. Plus it has some nature sounds that are great for soothing. The lights arent overbearing and the attachable toys are quite cute. My son especially liked the chimes. The mirror has a bit of funhouse effect but he didnt mind, he could still see himself so he was happy. Overall, this is an awesome activity gym.",5

"Frenchie Girls Fashion Jewelry Bib, Pink","Nice. Wide on the shoulders to keep messes down. Love the stitching and the waterproof middle.The only thing is that it wrinkles up in the wash, or rather in the dryer. It says you can use an iron but c'mon, I don't have time to iron baby bibs. I just stretch it out a little by hand. Not a big deal, but it is a little wrinkly now. Doesn't affect how it works, though! Still just as waterproof.",4
Metalica Pliko P3 MT Stroller,The under carriage storage compartmet is very uncomfortable. I have a HARD time trying to put my medium size baby bag in the basket every time; So I just don't use it. I have to either carry the bag or hang it on the strollers handle.,3
Evenflo Comfort Select Performance Dual Electric Breast Pump,"With my first child, I breastfed for 9 months and worked full time. This pump seemed to do the job quite effectively! I would not know if it is noisy or not considering I have never used another pump, but it is not bothersome. I gave it 4 stars because both side are quite heavy and for a multitasking mom it is impossible to use a pumping bra. Other than that, I would say this is a great buy!",4
"Gerber 4 Pack Prefold Birdseye Solid Diaper, Pink",I like to use these to add embellishments on for baby gifts. I like that they come in a variety of colors and wash well. They are also a nice size (so many burp cloths now are long but skinny). I will buy these again. The only reason I am giving four stars is because they are not super high quality...but it's fine for the price. :),4
"Summer Infant CushyStraps, Pink","We were going on a long car trip and I didn't want my daughter to have a neck cramp so we purchase this.  It didn't keep her head straight but I think it did give her a nice cushion to rest her head.  Also, it's super cute.",3

Just Gingham Furniture/Drawer Knobs - Color: Petal Pink,"I received this item a few months ago, and just got around to opening up the package recently. I was dismayed that there was only one (1) knob in the package, and nothing else. This came with no hardware whatsoever, not even on the back of the knob itself. You should know that if you order this, you are only getting one of these.",3
"Green Sprouts Cornstarch Hand Teether PVC, BPA, and Petroleum Free!","This has been a favorite of both my babies!

Perfect for a first rattle!",5

"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Navy","We have the Joovy Room and this. We bought this for our temporary housing when we were moving. We also purchased the mattress (Dream on Me - cheap one). It is lightweight, compacts to a small size, is comfy, and fits standard play sheets. The Joovy is under a bed somewhere and we use this all the time for sleepovers, playing, napping and general containment needs.",5
"Colgate Mattress 3 Sided Contour Changing Pad, Quilted White","I live right down the street from the Colgate factory so when it was time to buy a matrress and changing pad I immediately checked out Colgate's selections!  I bought an antique dresser as a changing table and the changing pad fits perfectly!  Also, the curves on edge of the pad are high enough to help ensure that the baby does not roll around too much!  Overall great purchase!",5
"OXO Tot Roll Up Bib, Aqua","So, I've been using this OXO bib for a few weeks now, and I'm actually surprised that it has held up as well as it has. Our daughter is ten months old, and every bib she has is pretty disgusting looking at this point. Not to mention that some are a pain to put on. OXO has a good chunk of benefits over the everyday cloth ones we used to use.1. The material: It is super easy to just wipe off most anything that falls on the bib, and the pouch is just everyday plastic that is also easy to clean. Just run the thing under some warm water and you are done most of the time.2. The pocket: Our other bibs are flat, and I'm not sure why we waited this long to get one with a pocket. The lower half of our child almost always ends up being covered in food paste, crumbs, or whatever is with in arms reach honestly. Our Australian shepherd used to sit by her high chair at dinner time so she could pick up the scraps. Unfortunately for her, there really are no scraps that miss the pocket for her to eat.3. The velcro: Velcro is so hit or miss with us since our daughter will just pull it apart if it isn't decently made, but we've had no problems with this bib.So, yeah, it's a bib, but it's a darn good bib. I would highly recommend it to parents who don't want to save on a bib load of laundry every week, and keep those pants clean a little longer.",5

Boba Baby Carrier Teething Pad - Natural,I purchased these at the same time I purchased my Boba so I put them on before I tried the carrier out on my baby for the first time. The second I put him in the carrier he started chewing on these teething pads. If I hadn't put them on he would have been chewing directly on the carrier. The carrier instructions say not to put it directly in the washing machine so I feel much better knowing that he was chewing on the pads (which I washed first in baby detergent). Plus I bought a few extra sets so if he is in the carrier for a long period of time and gets the pads really wet I can easily change them out. I would say these are a must have for your baby carrier while your baby is teething or for babies who just like to chew.,5

The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This product was not was I expected.

Nice creamy color too.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This is a great alternative to having pillows all around me. It's fairly comfortable, however getting out of it once you're in is tricky. Also, with a queen sized bed it takes up more of my share. Good product though.",4
Hello Kitty diecut face shape Area Rug 30 X 25 inches,"I would hesitate to call this a rug because it is so thin and it had a petroleum odor.  I had bought it for my 5 year old granddaughter's room, but did not want to give it to her because of the odor.  I had nothing to lose, so I washed it in the washing machine.  This did help and it did not harm the felt-looking appliques.  She uses it by her bed and it looks cute; I feel better about it since I was able to wash it; however there were no tags on it to tell how to care for it, so I took a chance that it could have ruined it.",2

"Gift Mark Honey Deacon Style Toy Box with Spindle Back and Casters, Honey",I bought this for my grandson. It was difficult to put together as holes were not drilled in spots where they should have been. The bottom of the box wasn't cut square so it doesn't touch on both sides. The cover rubs the left side when it shuts. I feel as if I paid alot of money for the finished product!,3

"Pearhead Signature Frame, White","I used two of these frames for a baby shower game in which I put pictures of a boy and a girl baby morphed from pictures of the mother and father to be in them. Instead of having shower guests sign their name to the matte, we had them write their baby name suggestions and then voted. It went great and the frames were nice and sturdy for writing. No pen in the box, but all the pens we used were fine as far as not bleeding, etc.",5
"Yellow &amp; Orange Sun, Blue &amp; White Clouds Wall Mural Stickers - Sticker Decals for Children's, Nursery &amp; Baby's Room Decor, Baby Walls, Girls Bedroom Decorations. Garden Cloud Suns Decal Child's Murals Birthday Party Baby Shower Decoration",From the images it was too hard to tell the quality of the product. They were hard and non-pliable and would have been ideal to stick to a whiteboard or posterboard but not a wall. They fell off within a day and are now in the garbage.,1
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","My wife and I bought this for our baby girl, and we absolutely love it. The design is great, and there is enough room to keep all the importante memories.",5
Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"I was hesitant to buy this at first, since it was brand new and there were no reviews out on it yet.  But, let me tell you - it was worth every penny!  This mobile is made by the same company as the popular 'symphony in motion' mobile, so the quality and durability is there.  For us, we loved the princess theme of the mobile and of course the cute pink colors.  Just like the symphony in motion mobile, the top part of the mobile can be detached from the music box base part.  There is a night lite option as well, and you can select either loud music or soft.  The classical songs that this mobile plays are perfect for soothing a tired baby or just as background music.  Another perk for us is the included remote control.  We hang it near our bed, so that we can operate it from across the room (baby's crib is in our bedroom).  If you are considering this mobile for your baby girl, we highly recommend it.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I have scoliosis and so I really needed to make sure I had a good baby carrier to make sure I don't do further damage to my back. I had previously read reviews about the lumbar support for this carrier so that's why I bought it. So far, it's been pretty good. I can carry my 16-lbs baby for 2 hours pretty comfortably (still a bit sore on the shoulders afterwards, but it's not bad). The only thing I worry about is that the materials is pretty thick and it can probably get pretty hot. My baby hasn't complained yet though. I might recommend that you look into the newer Baby Bjorn Synergy which is suppose to be lightweight AND provides back support. But, if you like the Active carrier, Amazon really has the BEST price for this item!",4
WubbaNub Infant Pacifier Alligator - Limited Edition,I bought this pacifier to replace the puppy one we had that was lost.  I was excited when I saw that there was an alligator to chose from I had to get it since my son's room theme was baby alligator's.  This product &#34;Wubanub&#34; is a great product.  It is very durable and you are able to wash it easily in the wash!!,5

"BabyKicks Basic Cloth Diaper Snap Closure, Meadow","These fit WAY too snug. The video says up to 40lbs and it is too tight on my 29 lb 2 year old. The video also states these are bamboo velour inside with microfleece under the velour (similar to the old style snugglebees). Which is what sold me to buy these. However these are a simple PUL outer layer with a white microfleece inner.The insert is the typical stick-to-your-finger microfiber on one side with the hemp on the other. However they stuck the tag on the hemp side of the insert, which according to the description you are supposed to be able to place facing your child. But in my house this wont work since my child has sensitive skin and ANY tag causes her to itch like crazy. It is also hard to stuff as the insert feels too large for the diaper and is bunchy. In fact even if you don't stuff it and just lay it on top it still sticks almost an inch out the back. So I had to cut off almost an inch from the back of the insert and sew it closed. This cut the tag off (solving that issue) and also made the insert fit better into the diaper.Also after just one day of use one of the leg snaps just pulled out as I tried to unsnap this diaper!  I am returning the other three I purchased and would not buy these again.** UPDATE **  I just was researching around and found out that the video on this diaper is for theBabykicks 3G Pocket Diaper, Meadow/White Snapswhich DOES have the bamboo velour inner, contoured insert and fleece gussets.  The video needs to be removed off this listing.",1

Highly recommend!",5

Petunia Pickle Bottom **NEW Spring 13** City Carryall-Breakfast in Berkshire,"For my first child (now 16 months) I was so into the &#34;non-diaper&#34; bag that I bought a beautiful Lacoste bag instead. Big mistake. It was trendy and cool, but the lack of pockets and organization that a real diaper bag has ensured that I NEVER carried it - instead just stuffed random things in my purse which would all jumble at the bottom.  Now that i'm 5 months pregnant again, I am returning to my diaper bag search. I was advised to look at Petunia before but originally stopped looking at them because they are too cutesy - not really a diaper bag in disguise. But then I saw a CAKE by Petunia on pinterest and decided to look at the whole Petunia line again.I ordered the City Carryall, and the CAKE Society and Hampton. Ultimately, I kept the Hampton Holdall, but if the City had come in CAKE, I might have kept both.Highs1. Really good &#34;day&#34; size. I just need to carry, a couple bottles, some crackers, some face wipes, a small toy, and maybe one diaper for each kid - along with mom's phone and wallet. Extra clothes, full meals, etc are not what I need to fit.2. LOVE the built in diaper pad feature. Just perfect for those months when your new baby is pooping often enough to need to change it in public instead of waiting until you are home.3. Overall good organization pocket configuration - I hate it when it all jumbles at the bottom.Cons1. Besides the way the diaper changer zipped side creates a pocket, there is really only one main compartment. This makes it tough to dig for mom's wallet underneath the bag of crackers and face wipes. I really wanted a bag with 3 main compartments which is the main reason I'm keeping the Hampton Holdall.2. I'm not into the cutesy patterns all that much. I wanted a more incognito bag. I liked the patterns and the fabric quality much better than it shows in the pictures, but its still more &#34;baby&#34; than I hoped. The CAKE line is also bold colors, but they are more luxury purse like than the standard Petunia look. If the City had come in the CAKE line, I probably would have kept it as a 2nd bag.Other bags I considered were the Charlie by SoYoung, the Cake Society Satchel, and the Cake Hampton Holdall. I'm keeping the Hampton.",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","These types of bibs are a must have for any parent. WE got this one for a gift, but our Bumpkin waterproof bid that we used worked so well it was the only bid we needed. It kept our son clean while he was eating and it is easy to wash off.",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I am generally happy with this stroller. I bought it for the following reasons:a. It's ability to add a second seat (I have one child now...but hope to have more in the future)b. The multiple positions and reclining options.c. Ability to manoeuvre easily on rough terrain (our roads aren't paved)d. It's good looks!!! Their ad got me!I got mine at Ideal Baby on sale with the chaperone car seat thrown in for free!!! Yeah!!! :) lol!However here are a list of my major concerns:1. This stroller is heavy (and I don't even have a second seat yet!) - We use this stroller at home for walks around the neighbourhood. This stroller is annoying to lug in and out of the trunk and difficult to fold up and unfold. We leave it opened out so it's easy on everyone in the house, baby-sitter and my mom included (cause they'll have zero help when they're ""on duty"" and we're not home). If we're going to the mall etc we use an UppaBaby stroller which is permanently in the trunk.2. The model we own was made in June 2011 and had a buckle that was really difficult to manoeuvre, it took ages for me to get my baby out of the stroller!!! Then one day I actually clipped my baby's skin in between the buckle! That was traumatic; it really hurt her (based on the way she screamed and cried almost unconsolably!). She's okay now of course, but still as the scar 5mths later. Anyways I called Britax to complain about the buckle and they sent me an entire new seat for free! So Customer Service is impressive. The buckle on the 2012 is waaay easier to operate.3. The arm bar has a foam covering over it for cushioning (I suppose). But as any other 8-12month old my baby nibbles at the foam!!! And x2 I saw black foam residue all over her mouth, the baby-sitter concurred with her determination to eat the arm bar so we decided to remove it totally. Which of course is removing a protective system. I am yet to contact Britax about this problem.4. It would be good if the seat can be turned rear or forward facing using a pivot rather than detaching the entire seat like the Orbit Baby (which is 3 times the cost of this stroller!). Because one moment we may be stroller with our backs to the sun and then the other moment we're facing the sun. And even though the canopy is large, it can only do so much. And you're not supposed to convert the seat while the baby is in it.Anyways so those are the major concerns with this stroller. But for the price (mid to high end) it has great features, solid safety ratings on their car seats and great customer service.  I think it's a great choice. Be sure to compare against the Baby Jogger City Select b4 you buy.",4
"Mary Meyer Print Pizzazz 12&quot; Plush Toy, Dots Giraffe","We now own two of these little guys.  You have to have a back up just in case one gets left on the top of the car, chewed up by the dog or dropped in the toilet (this last one actually happened).  Unfortunately, he can tell the difference between the two.It says spot clean but we've thrown ours in the wash machine and let it air dry on a rack.  My 2yr old is in love with this puppy - she comes everywhere with us.  She did get a little hole by the leg due to being pulled out of the crib between the slats too many times but sewed her up good as new.  There are some little balls/beans in her rear but I'm not worried about it.",5

"DaVinci Classic Sleigh Glider and Ottoman, Beige/Espresso Legs",If you are looking for a solid glider this DaVinci Glider is what you should buy. We are very impressed by the quality of the glider. It shipped extremely fast and was very easy to put together. This glider is definitely worth the price.,5
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,"Great system for mashing up food for baby.  Baby food is expensive, so this is a great way to smash the food we eat into a form that my son can eat.",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"I live in a big, old house (with 4 floors) and this monitor only worked between 1 floor.  Interestingly, the less expensive monitor I bought before this one worked from the basement to the 3rd floor whereas this Sony only worked between 1 floor.  And, it beeps all the time for no reason.  I had to return it because even when it was working (which was not all the time) the beeping drove me crazy.  Not a good product.  We had iPads people.  How hard is it to design a decent baby monitor?  When Apple gets into the baby monitor business I'll be their first customer.",1
Clevamama Clevabath Mat and Kneeler,"This mat was perfect for keeping kids from slipping in the tub. It is almost the entire length of the tub, soft for sitting on, suctions well to bottom of tub and has no unusual smell as other mat reviews noted. Kneeler is small and a bit squshy but works fine and was not the priority of this purchase.",5
Dwinguler Eco-friendly Kids Play Mat - Safari Tour (Large),"We purchased this (large) play mat 2 months ago when my baby was 4 month old. It was delivered fast. I like the product right after I opened the box---the color and graphics was beautiful, the foam was supportive and soft, and it didn't have any bad smell. My baby loved playing on it. I felt comfortable lying on it, too. At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but now I think it's totally worth it!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Green, Spirit","I received this carrier and I absolutely love the color, durability and feel. Thanks a million because my little one will get plenty of use from this carrier!!",5
KidCo SecureStick Appliance Lock,"A little bit of background here.  I've got three kids; a four year old, three, and 14 month old.  Baby proofing my house takes a little more effort because I try to get my older two to be more independent.  So baby proofing but accessible.  I've got this step-to-open garbage can that the older two need to get into but not the baby.  As soon as I stuck this on the garbage can the baby ripped it off.  I applied stronger adhesive backing and the baby broke it off! I give this three stars because I should have thought of that.  I believe that this product is good if you have one kid and one kid only or if your older kids need a certain level of security because you'll put it out of reach when on your refrigerator.",3
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I bought this after hearing so many people talk about full evacuations. I bought two and gave one to my brother.  This did nothing for me or my brother.  I sat on my thrown and put my feel on this stand and nothing happened. With no slight to the seller because it shipped out fast and packaged great, but this is a waste of money",2
"Naturepedic Waterproof Fitted Crib Pad, 28x52",My 3 1/2 year old daughter sleeps in a queen sized bed. As we try to wean her from pull-ups there are always a few accidents and this cover has not let any moisture through to the mattress.  It was a great buy!,5
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,I purchased this to close a room off from our new labrador puppy. It was simple to install and is easy to install. It is not a super strong gate and could be broken in you push on it too hard but I am happy with the purchase.,4
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,"My daughter is 3.5 months old and can hold her head up on her own.  She loves to be held in a standing position and ""walk"" around.  My husband and I wanted to find a toy that would hold her up, but we have read bad reviews about walkers.  This bouncer is just what we needed.  After quite a bit of research, we picked this one and I am so glad we did. The construction is sturdy and the toys are very engaging.My daughter absolutely LOVES it! Her little legs barely touch the base at the shortest setting, but she happily stands on tippy toes. She loves to bounce and is very interested in the toys.  The lights and sounds might get slightly annoying to some parents, but it entertains her for 30min+ at a time.  We have only had this for a few days, but I am already noticing an improvement in her motivation to grab for toys and she also needs less assistance while trying to sit.  Hopefully she will enjoy this for many more months to come!***Note: we did not buy this from Amazon, as we found the EXACT same thing at Costco for $89.99.  If you are a Costco member, I would see if your local branch carries this.",5
"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Little Cars, Small","We were looking for lightweight sleep sacks that had some fabric coverage for our twins' arms. This seems to be the only choice on the market right now, so we gave them a try. (We've been using Halo Sleepsacks.) These are a good lightweight option, but the materials used in these seem a bit cheaper in quality (the zipper, and the general construction) compared with the Halo Sleepsacks. It drives me crazy that the zipper is on the side of the blanket... it's much harder to get on a squirming infant than the center-zip sleep sacks. But it does cover their arms, so that makes me happy.",4
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","it's the only bottle I was able to have my baby drink from...not that he loved it, but at least it's the only one that he actually ate something from...",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).",5
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"this is the best drying rack.it takes loads of bottles & accessories & it has like a pocket on the top for spoons or other tall accessories.it spins for easy access. great price.i bought other brand that's supposed to be bigger & its more money. but i returned it & got that one, as it didnt hold as much stuff as this one.its made out of plastic, but its sturdy enough to hold loads & loads of baby bottles & accessories.I have it for 6 months & still working very well.I would for sure recommend that product for everyone.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This playpen is great my granddaughter loves it.  We take it camping with us,and use it at home.  It goes up and down easily and stores easily.  This is a very good playpen.",5
Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket,"Product looks great at first, but after my 2yr old started to use it for preschool, the zipper went off its track almost immediately....I guess from the daily use. And the stitching slowly started coming undone. If we got 3months use out of it.... It's an exaggeration.  It felt terrible taking it from my 2yr old. I think he's their biggest fan.",2
Sealy Baby Ultra Rest Mattress,"Picking a mattress is a difficult decision, it is hard to know if one will be the right one,when you look for a mattress for your self you can just lay on them and if they feel right you know, with a crib mattress your baby wont tell you if it feels right, for one they dont know and they cant tell you with words..Most importantly when looking for a crib mattress you want something that is safe (not too soft, or too small) and will hold up until they move on to a big kid bed.We picked/ and like this mattress for a couple reasons:It fits our Crib (Davinci ""Parker"" 4-1)like a glove, no space between.. so its safe. It has a waterproof nonallergic top layers so you don't have to worry about ""fluids"" absorbing and it doesnt make a plastic noise when you push down on it, it was firm enough but still a little soft to comfort baby, also has a 15 year warranty.I have yet to see a bad review for this mattress, and I personally recommend this mattress to my friends.",5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",This cup is impossible for myself and my husband to open! We were only able to use this cup once since it never opened again. I have a friend who is having the same problems with this cup.Also it is not what we were looking for it is to spill proof I was looking for a cup to transition from the playtex straw cups to a regular cup. I wish we had removed the valve before giving it to my daughter.,1
Safety 1st Musical Talkin Potty and Step Stool,I got this for my 20 month old son. When he tries to use it he ends up peeing on the floor. What they call a pee shield doesn't shield! I thought it would be great seeings he like to flush the toilet. Works great for girls though.,1
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)",I have other Summer Infant SwaddleMe's and they are great. These particular ones are too stretchy though and baby breaks out of the swaddle and wakes himself up :(,3
Vilac Set of 56 Alphabet Magnets,"These letters are nice looking, but I was disappointed in the size. They are the same size as the small, cheap plastic magnet letters.  I know I should have paid closer attention to the size details, but I thought the picture made them look bigger. I got them for my 2 year old and I was really hoping for larger letters, especially for the price. The box says not for 0-3.  I do not know about the quality because I have not opened the box since I may return them.  They do come in a nice small wooden box and I like the patterns.",3
Summer Infant Secure Surround Playsafe Playard,"Since all of the puppy play pens appeared to be too low, flimsy, or chewable, I went with a children's babygate instead. Ridiculously easy to set up, open, close, carry with the strap, remove panels, etc. I used mine to make a safe area for my 4 lb dog, who is a jumper and a chewer, and he cannot even come close to jumping out, tipping it over, or chewing through it. And he likes it because he can easily see us through the holes, unlike some solid panel dog playpens.Note - When using only 5 or 4 panels, it is more wobbly than 3 or all 6, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  Place something on the inside corner, like a doggy crate, or outside corner (place in the corner of a room so the walls are against two sides) to brace it.",4
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This is GREAT!!! My husband and I LOVE THIS! It's so incredibly east to dispose of the dirty, stinky diapers and the stink is completely trapped. The bag is equally easy to change when ready to dispose of the diapers. It's amazing how that when the smelly diaper goes in, the smell is instantly gone. FABULOUS!",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella",Great carseat for grandparents car. Easy to install. Fits nicely in smaller 2 door backseat. Kids like it. Great price!,4
Double Swivel Green 3in1 Bicycle Bike Trailer Baby Stroller Jogger Carrier,"The information on this product states that the front wheel can be locked for jogging or swivel for walking around, that is false.  The front wheel does NOT lock in any shape, form or fashion.  I am very disappointed and would warn anyone that wants to utilize this as a jogging stroller, to look anywhere else.  The front wheel going crazy even when walking at a brisk pace.  I can use it as a bike stroller but I was specifically looking for a double use product and this is not.",1
Phil &amp; TedsSport Buggy Travel Bag,Don't get me wrong. I love the seat and style of the stroller. That's why I bought it but since I've had it I've struggled getting the brake up and down. I feel like I'm realignment it everytime I do it and now I actually use to get down on my hands and knees the yank the brake up. So pissed that I didn't just go with the BOB again! There's breaks are awesome!,1
"The First Years  Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit, Black/Gray",It is very easy to carry and very practical too. I can keep a couple of diapers and other hygiene items inside the bag.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We purchased the ""Jumperoo"" for our Granddaughter, and she loves it. The seat rotates, it has four height positions. We had to use a pillow at first; her feet didn't quite touch the floor. It is well made. Although it all snaps together, it is not designed to fold and store. You will need about a 3'x3' space for it. Other than that, very entertaining for her.",5
"Kids Line Luxury Security Blanket, Pink","Although my granddaughter likes  the blanket, the blanket is only fuzzy on one side and extremely light weight.  Showed significant lint loss during the first wash.",3
GroVia Wetbag - Vanilla,"When I ordered this I thought I was buying a diaper pail liner. Turns out its a smaller bag. it's too big to be used in my diaper bag but too small to use as a hanging bag.  It works fine as a wet bag but I have no use for a bag this size. I would have returned it had I not been required to pay return shipping, which would have cost as much as the item itself. Overall I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.",2
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","Not what I was looking for. My wife and I wanted something to clean our kid's straws. I saw some lady on amazon mention these as a good option so we picked up a set. I was very disappointed in the quality. I know this was not its intended use and its only a few bucks but I still wish it was a little more sturdy. Anyway, I found something else that I'm a lot happier with. If you want something for your straws get the Sippy Stuff straw brush. If you don't mind switching brushes every now and then get these. They come four in a pack.",3
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",This is an awesome chair especially for the price.  You aren't getting something cheap and my daughter uses it every day!,5
SoHo Froggies Party Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"This is an okay set. I was a little afraid I order it after reading some of the reviews but for the price I was pleased. A couple of little things you should know... The green looks subdued in the pictures but when you get it, it's really a bright green. And he blue is slightly brighter too. Yes, the bumper is thin, but that's the way they recommend them to be now. I did however have one of the ties fall off as I was tying it to the rail. It didn't unravel or anything and I was able to stitch it back on easily. Like I said, for the price it's okay but don't expect it to last for multiple kids.",4
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,With my first child I took some advice and didn't get a video monitor. People said it would make me check on the baby everytime she stirred. Well after about 6 months I wish I had not taken the advice and had gotten a video monitor because I wanted to see my baby and what she was doing so that I knew whether or not I really needed to go into her room. So with this 2nd baby I decided I would just go ahead and get this video monitor. Now that we have been using this video monitor for two weeks and I LOVE it!!!! We bought an extra camera so that we could have one in each room. The picture is very clear and it is super to switch between cameras. It's so great being able to see what the kids are doing and whether or not they are just stirring in their sleep or if they are really awake without having to go into their rooms and risk them actually waking up.,5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Bassinet Sheet, Celery",Soft and durableEasy to wash and fit on mattress.  Stayed on the mattress very well. I would buy this again.,4
"I Love My Nana (Pink T-Shirt, size 2T)",I was really looking forward to receiving this.  I was disappointed that it does not seem to stay snapped.  It also stretches out of shape.,2
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,We love this! I wish I had bought 2 -- one for home and one to take out with us. The rubber inner grip holds the cup well. Easy to use and saves bending over to pick up the cup again and again.,5
Drinking Cup Spouts (Assorted Colors) 2 Count,I was excited that their was something safe for my new baby.  I'm glad that he is being exposed to less toxins than his big sister.  But they leak like crazy compared to other cups we've used.,3
"Bright Starts My First Cookbook, Pink","My daughter 6 moths old loves this book.  The fun of a book, teething parts to chew on that are easy for her to hold and find, tags to chew, and it is fun to fling around.  Most definitely the BEST of all the fabric book/teether toys we own.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,Love this pump! This is the only pump I use and it is super easy to clean and it gets milk out really fast. I originally got it from the hospital where my daughter was born and I've been using it since. I just ordered another one so that I can alternate when one is dirty.,5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"I've owned this humidifier for a little over a year now, and it's never let me down.  The product description is a little lackluster though.  I wouldn't use this in a room that's over 500 sq ft.  It worked great in my bedroom last winter, but I have an open floor studio apartment now (around 7-750 sq ft) and it's just not enough.  Even with refilling it twice a day and having it run 24/7 the humidity level in the air has never been above 40% (and that was on a warm, rainy day).Very quiet operation, when turned up all the way the most you will hear is a slight ""trickling"" noise from the ultrasonic waves splashing the water around.Make sure the surface you put it on is level.  Even a slight bit off can cause it to leak water.In the past I've needed to buy on average a new humidifier each winter because they're always cheap and crap out, not so with this one. Overall the merits of this humidifier vastly out weigh my complaints.",4
"Carters 2 Pack Keep Me Dry Quilted Crib Pad, White","They are made of a very good fabric, but kind of small.I thought it was for cribs, but it's more for basinets or changing tables.It works good for small babies.",3
"Moby Wrap MLB Edition Baby Carrier, SF Giants","I love this Moby Wrap! I also have an ERGObaby carrier and this is an excellent additional option to use with my 6 month old. I refuse to put her in any type of carrier where her legs dangle straight down (like a Baby Bjorn) and this wrap fits the bill perfectly! When you take the wrap out of the package, it may seem overwhelming because of the amount of fabric, but in all honesty it's really easy to use. The wrap comes with a photo booklet that shows you how to do all the different wraps. This wrap is also incredibly comfortable! I highly recommend it to all mothers! Go Braves!",5
Baby Gear 2 Piece Blanket Set Giraffe (Blanket + Security Blanket),"My one year old loooove this giraffe so so much, he can't sleep without this! I lost his first one ( babyshower gift) when we were at Target and boy, that night I can tell he can't sleep. I looked all over and it's only available at amazon. Quite expensive but I jhave to buy it.  I am just glad they have it, coz if the baby can't sleep, mommy can't sleep too. He had this since he was born. And we always take this everywhere we go. For some reason this thing comfort him. When he's crying he will look for his giraffe and he will snuggle it... It's cute . I will buy another one. hopefully they will lower the prcie :)",5
"Jumping Beans&reg; Butterfly Hooded Bath Towel, in Pink","Love it, the only negitive is that it took about 4 washings to stop the little pink fuzzies fromngetting  everywhere.",4
Pacifier - Wubbanub Infant Plush Pacifier - Turtle,"Slides off my 3 month old a little easier than the frog, but it's still an awesome product.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  Survives the washing machine very well.",5
Peg perego Primo Viaggio SIP Convertible Car Seat Cacao,This is a bit pricey so at first i was hesitant in purchasing since I had not been able to see it in person since not many places carry this seat just online. I happened to find a place in San Antonio on our to el paso (8 hr road trip) it too me less than second to decide to buy after seeing the quality!!! It's so comfy. My other car seat was the britax boulevard which is still in $300 price range but I wish I would have never spent my time or money on that one since this exceeds all expectations. I ended uP purchasing 2!!! One for the other car we have. I recommend this seat to anyone and everyone-: don't give the price a second thought since you will be using it for at least until your child hits 70 pounds!! Well worth the investment and my daughter loves it more. I no longer hear her complain about being in her car seat!!,5
Bamboobies Super-Soft Washable Nursing Pads - All Pale Pink,"I am a new mom and these work perfect for me!  I don't leak a lot so I decided to get some washable nursing pads.  My friend recommended these for me (and she leaks a lot!). They do slide around sometimes and can get bunchy looking if you don't position them right, but these are very minor problems compared to spending money every month on disposable ones.  Over all, I am very happy with my purchase.",4
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","I really like these bags. They're super durable, but thick and pliable. I bought the 50 pack to try when my baby was first born. I got through the first 25 and loved them. But after about the 5th bag in my second set of 25 they began to leak badly at the bottom. I had pumped 4 oz and put it in the bag, as usual, and it began to drip. My hubby quickly got out another bag and we transferred the milk and that one also began leaking. We poured the milk into the bottle because obviously it wasn't a one time deal. I put water in 4 more bags and realized they were ALL leaking. I looked in my freezer to make sure they hadn't leaked without me knowing it and there didn't seem to be an issue. I called the company and made them aware and asked them if they could replace the bags. They were VERY nice, took my address, phone number, and said they'd send me 100 new bags and to return the leaking bags so they could examine them. Sweet! Well, that was 7 or 8 weeks ago and I haven't seen or heard anything and have never received new bags. So, Lansinoh bags are my new friend. They're similar enough, but I'm bummed because I really did want to LOVE Honkeysuckle.Update 11/25I received my replacement bags, but they leaked on me again. This time I'm not even going to bother calling for replacements. I lost over 2 oz of precious milk in a cup of warm water when defrosting. I was pretty mad.",2
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"My daughter sleeps with a sound machine in her nursery.  When on the go, she loves her crib and the Sleep Sheep allows her to feel like she is in her crib.  It has great volume control and helps her to fall asleep and STAY SLEEPING since the sounds help to null out any sudden noises- like her brother yelling in the stroller next to her!  I bring the Sleep Sheep everywhere and tell all my mommy friends to invest in one.",5
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,Ferrets are super climbers sometimes. This gate is perfect to keep them confined during their out of cage time. It is short enough to step over easily though. I have purchased two of these because they are so great!,5
Skip Hop Backpack WITH Lunchie (Zebra),"Very cute product, and versatile.  I like how the lunchie has a clip on the handle, it clips onto the stroller nicely.  Roomy enough for 1-2 meals for my todder plus an ice pack.  The backpack is fine, seems sturdily constructed.  The panda is quite adorable!",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This is a very simple yet affective baby monitor. No setup required. Just place the camera in a spot you want and turn on the monitor. The picture is very good. The plastic belt hook feels a bit cheap, but I usually have it just sitting on the counter or nightstand so that doesn't bother me.",5
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","I adore this boon product! I love that is provides convenient storage for all of the bath-time essentials and it is cute and sturdy! It stays put and my son loves looking at it during bath-time. I even hang wash clothes on  the &#34;hands&#34; to dry out before throwing them in the dirty clothes. The little soap bottle shelf is perfect too! I love that it isnt a little mesh-net and that it doesnt have suction-cups to stay in place (bc those NEVER work). One piece of advice though...if you bathe your child in a garden tub or something other than a typical bath tub, make sure you have enough wall-space to hang this guy. He is pretty long and wide and he needs a decent sized wall to hang to. Just keep this in-mind!",4
Belvah Large Quilted Polka Dot 3pc Diaper Bag (Black/ Multi),"Received this as a baby shower gift, I have a two year old and a new born and everything I need for them fits neatly inside (5 size 1 diapers, 3 size 3 diapers, a blanket, and a outfit for my newborn).",4
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","We have one in the diaper bag, one in the living room, and one in the bedroom. Two extras for when they're in the laundry. Wash up well and are easy to throw into a bag for use on public changing tables.",5
Eddie Bauer Fold and View Mirror,"Edited 6 mo later:  Now that I've gotten used to it, I like it OK.  It is small, which is good and I find that most of the time, I just need to check her face anyway.  If I need a better view, I use my visor mirror.  I still don't highly recommend it, but it's not so bad.Pros:  It attaches to the rear view mirror easily and isn't bulky.  The fit on the rear view mirror is adjustable for different sized mirrors and is a tight, secure fit.Cons:The mirror is too small and not clear enough.  Only gives enough view to see the face of my toddler and it isn't a clear view at that; looks distorted.Vibrations from the car cause the mirror to constantly vibrate.Gets in the way when using the passenger visor.  Knocks it out of whack, which requires it to be readjusted.I would not buy this again.  I got it on sale and still feel that way.",2
"Innobaby Glass Rectangle Food Storage Container, 2 Pack, Yellow/Green","It Was bought originally for my daughter as a lunch box. The quality looks good,But I did not expect it is too small, It is Poker card size. Now I have to buy another bigger one.",4
Baby Chef Ultimate Baby Food Maker,"i should preface this by saying that in order to make baby food, you don't actually ""need"" a baby food maker.  i was from the school that believed that i could do it with what i already had and take up less counter space.  i used a pot and steaming basket to steam (shock) and a cuisinart to process.  it was fine.HOWEVER...i bought this product bc we are going away and i dont anticipate use of a stove.  i should have bought it ages ago!  it makes things so easy -- the same unit for both steam and puree, and it CLEANS SO EASY!!overall i love it, i spent the weekend stocking up; i was that excited about it!PROS:easy to use- so easy it motivates you to make more food!easy to cleanevidently warms bottles.  i didn't use this function, but if i had known, perhaps i would have ditched the bottle warmer in the early months.PRICE!  about HALF the price of other baby food makers, if you use one go for this one!CONS: (but i weigh these a lot less than the PROS!!!)a little large.  all the baby food processors are, and this isn't any different.the storage bin underneath could be a little larger to hold one of the extra caps...you'll know what i mean when you see it.there could be a deeper well to catch the water from the outer steaming topOVERALL:BUY THIS.  i'm so glad i did!",5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I love the pattern on this.  I haven't used it, but I know it will cover me when I breast feed.  The material is good quality too.",5
Mia Rose Canvas Wall Art (Set of 3),I received this product promptly and it was well worth the price.  It looks wonderful in the baby's room.  I would recommend this product.,5
Sesame Street Elmo Car Seat Cover,"My daughter loves Elmo but when I received the carseat cover it was Dora, even my order slip had Elmo on it. I wrote to the sellers but they never responded back or tried to contact me. So I'm a little disappointed with the purchase but the cover does its job.",2
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White",This is the first video monitor we have bought. The picture quality is good and clear. It was easy to set up and it is easy to use at night. I like that you can set up the volume in the baby's room that will trigger the video monitor to go on. The one thing I don't like is the lullabies...The noise they make seems to trigger the video monitor to come on...I don't want to listen to the lullabies so we rarely use that feature.,5
Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,Found the product to be matching its description. My Baby boy sleeps good on this mattress. Couldn't be happier to find this as its in budget and works pretty good for my boy. Would definitely recommend.,5
Kushies Washable Pre-fold Diapers - Assorted,Much nicer then expected. Plan to use them as burp cloths for the grand babies. Was planning to use to make designer burp cloths when I ordered. But they are so nice I plan to use them as is.,5
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal","This fits a crib mattress just fineIt&#8217;s a typical fitted bed sheetIt&#8217;s a stylish cover that comes from a fashionable lineOf little froggies that&#8217;s really neatI like this cover as it fits perfectly, does the job, is a little thin, but no complaints.",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","When I started pumping I thought I would not be able to make it for a long time. My hands got numb keeping the funnels against my breast, and I had tons of spills. Then I searched for a solution and found this bra. I thought it was kind of pricy but now I think this has been a great investment. I have a 5 months old baby and I am a working mom. Thanks to this product and a great breast pump (if you are really into it you need to have a good pump as well) I am still breastfeeding and it is not painful anymore. I read news in my phone or use the computer while pumping. So, if you are a multitasking mom that is really into breastfeeding, a great pump and this bra is all that you need",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We first purchased one of those potty seats that has elmo on it thinking it would help motivate my son to want to sit on it.  It didn't fit our toilet seat and moved around a lot so my son wanted nothing to do with it.  I found this Babybjorn seat and it was a life saver.  It expands to fit any size toilet and it doesn't move.  After we purchased the first one we immediately went back and bought a second one for our other bathroom.,5
Inclined to Sleep,"What would we have done without this??  We have a corner crib, so mattress lifters didn't fit.  This was PERFECT!  It kept our little one in an inclined position all night so that we did not have any sleeping difficulties.  We went from awake every two hours cleaning up spit up, to sleeping for 4 to 5 hours at a time.  What a blessing!",5
"NUK Gerber Graduates 100% Silicone Platemat, 10 x 15",Great idea.  Folds up nicely in the diaper bag to take with us.  Nice to have something clean on the restraunt table that she's eating off of.  It is made of silicone but I wish it stuck to the table a little better.,4
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We have used two Summer Infant monitors and this Motorola. We feel strongly that Summer Infant is far better. This one looks more high tech and it does have the option of a camera that moves and intercom feature. However, what it lacks in other features and overall quality makes those features seem like small potatoes. First of all, the video feed is choppy at best. If you wave your hand in front of the monitor you will see it freeze about every two seconds. That's how the video feed is ALWAYS. I don't like that. With the Summer Infant I could literally watch my daughter's chest rise and fall because it was a smooth, real time, continuous video. This is not true of Motorola. Beyond this, the monitor buttons are awful and not designed for use in the dark. On the Summer Infant one, when the screen goes black there is a large button on top of the monitor that you just push and the picture returns. Think snooze button on the alarm clock big -- easy to find and hit in the dark. The Motoroloa button is a tiny button second from the bottom on the right. Yeah -- not helpful at all. Beyond this, the darn thing beeps when the battery is getting low. Obviously Motorola engineers did not consider the fact that for several months or longer many babies sleep in their parents' room and when baby is fussing or making noise it's nice to look at the monitor instead of getting up and going over to stand by the crib, possibly waking the baby with a creaky floor board or rustling around. The beeping wakes the baby! It also beeps randomly for some other reason which I will have to refer to the manual to figure out. It has a green light that flashes next to the on light when this beeping is going on. The screen is super bright too which is bad for having a baby in the room since the light illuminats the room and also shocks your eyes when you first turn it on. Last but not least, it interferes with both our Wifi and our other baby monitor that sits next to it. It's just not a smart design overall. I shoud have heeded other reviews about the lack of thought the engineers put into the design.I wish we had opened this monitor and used it for a few nights before our second daughter arrived. We would have returned it within the allowable time and bought another Summer Infant one. We were drawn in by the moving camera and two way talk features but I'd gladly give those up for a monitor that is intuitive and just works better.",2

"Preggie Drops,Natural Green Apple 21 Ct From Three Lollies","Let's face it- when you're in your 1st trimester, you just feel crappy.  These drops taste good and do provide some nausea relief.  They are on the sour side, which I love, but some may not.  I prefer drops in general because the lollipops can look a little weird and juvenile in a work/office environment.  If nothing else, they give you something sweet to distract your taste buds, even when you're hungry but really don't feel like eating.",4
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","My daughter was ALWAYS losing her pacifiers once her old pacifier holder got all gross and worn out and had to be thrown out.Bought this one, clamps right on, even when she throws her tantrums and tries with all her force to rip it off, she has only ripped it off once.This is a must have if you're always having to buy more pacifiers because all the others get lost or disappear. Have not lost a binkie ever since I bought this, a must have.",5

"JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp, White",This arm for a crib mobile is absolutely useless!  It's so short that the mobile hangs down on top of the baby!  I should have read the reviews before buying.  Do not waste your money!  It will only work if your mobile hangs down an inch or two.  Who designed this?  I'm returning it immediately.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,1
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large",Purchased for traveling by myself with baby and needed an easy to use carrier that would help me brought the airports. So glad I went with this product. It was so easy to use and my 3 month old loved it. He could enjoy time out of his stroller while I remained hands free. He likes is so much that he often falls asleep in it. I keep it in the car and take it with me everywhere.,5
"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slate","I absolutely LOVE this stroller! I originally wanted a Quinny (after seeing them all over Ireland) and then loved the Bugaboo. After doing tons and tons of research on strollers I narrowed it down to the Bugaboo and the UppaBaby.Every store I found only had one or two types of nice strollers. I finally found a store near Baltimore (Babies First in Columbia, MD) that has TONS of high-end strollers that you can test and compare. The UppaBaby Vista seemed sturdier than the Bugaboo, looked better and had WAY more storage underneath. That bag-thing that Bugaboo has looks really small! This storage is HUGE! I always carry around my huge purse, the diaper bag, and I usually end up stuffing in our coats, scarves, a blanket, shopping bags, water bottles, etc... it holds everything!Overall, I liked it much better once I saw them together! And Bonus: it was a LOT cheaper!! The ONLY difference I could find was that the Bugaboo's handle could flip/ switch directions rather than just lifting and changing the seat. It is SO easy to just un-click the UppaBaby seat and switch directions (so baby can face you) that it didn't even matter to me about the handle.UppaBaby is compatible with my Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat, you can add on their ""Rumble seat"" for an additional child, you can add on the ""Piggyback board"" for an older child, and you can buy tons of other accessories for it if you wish (like the awesome cup holder!).My baby is now almost 3 months old and I still love the stroller! It easily folds and fits in our SUV trunk, I've taken it on a 5k run/ walk, it it super easy to maneuver with one hand, and the fold-up cup holder is very handy!Although I had big plans to use it, I've only used the bassinet part once. Maybe because I am just too paranoid and I want him strapped in to his car seat though. I just wish the bassinet could stand up on its own on the ground (rather than collapsing) -but I guess that would defeat its purpose.If you are worried about price- you can buy accessories on eBay. Our dumb cat pooped in the toddler seat before our baby was even born so I freaked out and bought a new fabric set on eBay. I also had it dry cleaned and it turned out just fine! Thats an option if you have a major mess in the future.Also- the Peg Perego adaptor pegs are a bit tricky to line up sometimes, but I still like it just fine.The original color I loved was Miles Blue (turquoise) but it was only available in the 2010 model. Since I wanted a 2011, I have Cole Blue and it is beautiful!Overall- I am extremely happy with my stroller choice and I wouldn't go back on my decision!!! LOVE IT!",5
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"I am on round 2 of using these containers. The size is perfect. Don't fill them over the 2oz line though...or the expansion could damage them. The stacking isn't perfect, but I love the screw caps.",4

"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30&quot;, White","Most of the changing table pads are longer to fit the tables at Baby'r us, etc.  When we purchased an IKEA changing table we had to look for an alternative.

BabyBjorn Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Red,"We've tried SO many bibs with our one year daughter.

"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blue","The old one worked great!. We steered many people to using the odl Diaper Champ. We gave many as baby shower gifts. When we had our last child we thought we would buy the new model. It was horrible. It did not seal as well as the old one so unless you took great care to leave it perfectly aligned it would smell horribly. Also, taking loaded bags out of the new model was hard. It would snag on some of the innards sometimes ripping bags.If you can find the old model... I would buy that. I tried to tell Baby Trend about the issues with the new model... but they did not care. I used to love Baby Trend, however after my experience with their customer service regarding this model.... I have sworn them off. In fact I did not want to steer any traffic to them. However, if you can find the original designed model... I would try that. It worked GREAT for us and many many of our family/friends.",1

"Graco FastAction Fold Sport Stroller Click Connect Stroller, Gotham",I really like this stroller for several key reasons.1.  Heavy duty support of up to 50 pounds2.  Folds up reasonably small for bigger sized stroller3.  Front wheel system makes it MUCH easier to navigate a crowded area without running over toes!,5
"Edushape 4 Pack Sensory Ball Mega Pack, Colors May Vary","My son found these balls at a friends house.  I had to get them immediately!  The pack comes with two opaque, two translucent and one each small, the others big.  My son can palm the small balls, which make it fun for throwing.  The bigger ones make him use two hands to pick up and throw. Even the nubs on these are different (opaque to translucent), which makes the texture/weight/etc different and SENSORY!  He'll be playing with these for a while!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"After extensive research,I purchased this stroller to replace my bulky travel system for a trip to the Bahamas.  Upon receiving it, I was extremely pleased with the chic appearance, and ease of assembly.  The basket underneath, parent caddy, and higher handles made it really stand out in my opinion, especially for the price!But this is what really proved the stroller's worth in my eyes.  The morning of my trip, the stroller accidentally got RUN OVER...BY AN SUV...and dragged down the driveway.  And the only damage was a rear wheel came off partway, a small hole in the parent caddy, and some scratches in the paint.  The frame was fully intact...not even bent.  The stroller made it through the entire trip, and held up just fine.  If you're looking for GREAT quality at a GREAT price, this is your stroller!",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",Overall it is a good swaddle but as my dd moves around the swaddle pieces can get bunched up by her face.  When I check in on her I have to pull the cloth down.  Also the velcro is loud when you are trying to discretely adjust the swaddle.,3

"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",so easy to get kids into.  You can tell the quality just by the rubber on the bottom that goes on your vehicles seat.,5
Bugaboo Frog Stroller - Blue,"For many years the hype in Hollywood has been the strange looking Bugaboo strollers. So for the features we bought one..The Good: As a  petite woman I especially appreciate the inclusion of short handles on a stroller. The Bugaboo Frog does have perfectly placed handles where height is concerned. I have no problem reaching the handles and pushing my child around. I also get a thrill out of the ""one hand turn"" that the Frog allows you to accomplish. I find that my son seems comfortable in the Frog longer than his other strollers. I have a Fisher Price knock-off that he can easily get his way out of. He does tend to hate strollers, though. The navy blue color is especially aesthetically pleasing, as is the off white quilted-like design of the hood's interior. I have no experience with any shock to the stroller, but from what I have been told Bugaboo's can take a real beating. The stroller also drives extra smooth.The Bad: I cringe each time that I have to fold the Frog up and place it into the car. The tutorial video at Bugaboo's website shows the model taking it apart completely, piece by piece. I have no time for that. Taking the seat portion off requires two people, usually. I have bad joints and squeezing the white buttons on the side will not work for me.Unfolding the frame is even more hard. The frame has the tendency to make itself turn backwards. It also locks up and creates a major pain for those trying to fold it. Bugaboo really should fix this design flaw.",4
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"Anyone who has a baby knows how awful the bulb sucker you get at the hospital is. The baby screams and produces more snot than it sucks. This is a miracle, my baby actually laughs when I use it. After I got over the gross factor of sucking snot put with my mouth (the tissue is a great filter and I don't have to buy a separate filter) this cold and flu season won't be nearly so bad since I won't have a baby who's nose is constantly dripping and stuffed.",4

"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","This was great when I was timing my contractions, but wasn't as useful as I thought it would be once the baby came.

It would be cool if it could keep some kind of stats...",3

Summer Infant Plush n' Pink Single Bedrail,I bought this for my 4 year old. She absolutely loves it and thinks it makes her room even prettier. We have it set up so that there is a little room at the front of her mattress and a little room at the end so she can get into bed either way. The coverage is great. It is taller than our old one which I am ok with. The cover is soft and it is great that you can take it off to wash it. I couldn't do that with our old one. So far it is working great and haven't had any problems.,5
"Athena Daphne Convertible Crib and Changer, Cherry","This crib was designed to be used for several years as it moves from crib to toddler bed and possibly back to crib again for a 2nd child.  However, if you contact the manufacturer to ask for another copy of the instructions for this crib, they will tell you no.  I sent several emails and even included a photograph of the serial number sticker on the crib, and the company that makes this, AFG, refused to provide me with another copy of the instructions.  They were very rude and unhelpful.  If you want your crib to last a few years, and there is any chance that you might lose the original instructions, I would recommend getting a different crib from a different company.",1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This was recommended to me by my sister who had her baby over a year ago. She didn't discover this until months after having her baby and wished she had had it all along.I am a large breasted woman and my nipples are quite sensitive so the first time messing with this was challenging. It is great because you can adjust it in several ways to fit better, but I just didn't get the feeling of support and lining up my nipples with the pump pieces was difficult.For me, works best over a nursing bra so I have the support I need and it makes centering the plastic piece easier. So there is less pain and I feel like it sits well so I can do hands free. Now I can read, surf the Internet, eat etc all while pumping. So much faster than one at a time - although that is still an option if you are just feeding off one breast and pumping the other.A definite must have if you will be pumping a lot! I plan on taking with me to work so I can knock it out faster there as well.",4
Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,"After trying a few different chairs for a newborn, this chair was the least expensive and also the favorite one!I like the feature, that the bar with the animals is removable.

"ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Desert Bloom","Amazon sent me a FAKE ERGO which I carried my baby around in for 5 months. Amazon is well aware that they are using suppliers from companies who stock counterfeit carriers and yet they are denying me a full refund, instead giving me a ""Gift card"". I do not want a gift card as I want to purchase an ergo from a authorized retailer. I used my amazon credit card to purchase a true ergo from babies r us and they are still refusing to apply the gift card they gave us to pay the balance on the credit card. We've been on the phone now for over 2 hours trying to just use the gift card to pay our amazon credit card balance.Amazon is lucky my baby wasn't injured and they don't have a bigger problem on their hands.",1

Summer Infant Dr. Mom Gentle Vibrations Toothbrush,"I purchased this brush for my 16month old because she was always fascinated with my electric toothbrush. Looking for something without a Disney character on it brought me to this item. Unlike another reviewer, I think the vibrating action is just right for my daughter.Unfortunately the bayonet locking mechanism that is supposed to hold the brush head on the vibrating body is very flimsy and has, within 2 days of use, been almost completely whittled away by my daughter not only brushing, but also gnawing on the head, trying to brush other things and pushing down hard, etc.It still holds, and I haven't tried one of the other heads on it yet, but I would strongly advise the manufacturer to improve the connection point. The plastic used seems to delicate for a toddler's use. AND: once the nib on the vibrating body is gone, the heads will not stay on. There go the replacement heads...I have still recommended this product to others as it has turned my daughter from a toothbrush hater to a toothbrush lover",4
"Safety 1st onBoard 35 Infant Car Seat, Triton","I was a little skeptical at first about this carseat because it wasn't one of the popular brands that I saw everyone else using, but I was able to get this seat for such a great deal I couldn't turn it down.  We love this carseat so far!  Our newborn ended up being premature and this seat was able to fit her even when she was 5 lbs.  Only complaint is that it is hard to find car seat adaptors for strollers for this brand.  We purchased a baby jogger city mini stroller which we love and were able to use this seat with the adjustable belly bar as other reviewers recommended.  I preferred to have a good jogging stroller compared to a combination stroller/carseat set.",4
"Infantino Musical Push and Pull Toy, Giraffe","I agree with the other reviews here -- this is a completely charming pull toy, adorable (the colors are actually richer than the photo shows) with a wonderful little music box-style lullaby. It's true that the string is too short for my 16-month-old to pull around while she walks, but she loves it anyway. She'll actually pick it up and hug it like any other stuffed animal she has.  I love hearing the song over and over -- in fact, I got to this page because I was trying to find out if it's an actual song.",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"My husband installed these on every piece of furniture that could tip in our house. It took him about an afternoon, but we have a lot of furniture.

"Carters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Animal","Very soft, fits in the play yard great.  Not too much extra material so it's not loose, which has been a problem in the past.  Cute design.",4
"Foundations Trio Triple Tandem Stroller, Blue","We immediately took the stroller out of the box and and of course the 11 year old wanted to play with the box.  When we finally wanted to put the babies into the triple stroller the center restraint straps were cut in half.  It looked like they were cut with a box cutter.  Since the box was no longer intact we did not attempt to send back.We did figure out our own work around, however when you invest this kind of money you expect it to be in appropriate order.My advise - examine it as soon as you pull it out of the box.This product does make life a whole lot easier for my daughter who is adopting a set of twins and their brother who is 11 mo older.  going to the Dr. office was an  ordeal with all of them the car seats are so heavy.",3
Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - Farmyard,"At first, I was skeptical about purchasing this product.  I heard so many negative things about it not being good for a child's development.  However, I'm glad I changed my mind and bought it.  My girls really enjoy playing with the toy.  They're getting a workout without realizing.The only drawback is the assembly.  There are a million pieces.  They should have made this process easier.  Parents just don't have the time for such a thing.  Set aside several hours.",3

Baby Photo Album Record-A-Message,"My mother gave us this book after our son was born.  We enjoyed filling it up with pictures, which we did pretty quickly.  One of our favorite first pictures was a picture of my husband holding our son in the hospital bed across from me.  I woke up and saw he was asleep and cradling our son in his arms after being awake for our 26 hours of labor and delivery.  It's one of our favorite first pictures.  We were able to record the sweet little baby cry for our son too a few days later at home.  It was nice to be able to preserve that through this photo album.  This album is a great gift for new parents and a great way to preserve special memories through the voice recording and also through your favorite pictures.  Today, there are so many different kinds of technology available to video/record for memories too.  At the same time, it's special to have something you can look back on and actually hold in your hands.  Our son loves to look back through his baby book and hear his cry when he was so little.  It means a lot to him also to have something he can hold in his hands and look through.  That's something more modern technology doesn't always provide that's priceless.",5

If not, milk starts dripping on my skin. I wish the bra was deigned so that it can overcome that.",4
Battat Sound Puzzle Box,Haven't met a kid that doesn't love this.  It's a great starter shape sorter for kids and has a softer sound which is less scary for kids who have sensory issues.,5
Baby Trend Galaxy Flex-Loc Infant Car Seat,"I've been using this seat since my 8 month old was born and can't stand it.  He's small so he's still got a few pounds to go until we move him to a bigger seat.  I can't wait!  The handle gets stuck on the sunshade every time you move it up or down.  The handle release is akward and very hard to squeeze.  The buckle is also very akward to get buckled especially with a squirmy baby (although I suppose any seat is hard to buckle when they're squirming).  You have to fit together two small pieces and get them simultaneously clipped into the buckle.  It's not easy.  The only pros...I do like the triangular handle, it gives you many carrying options, nice fabric, and the built in level.  Also it has gotten good safety reviews.  In retrospect, we should've gone with the Graco Snugride.  Easier to use, a little cheaper, and got equal or better saftey ratings.  If we decide to have another baby, we definitely won't be using this seat.",2
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","The seam of the pillowcase at the neck part of the pillow cuts into my shoulder quite a bit. I cut the seam off and put a pillow case over the top, which solved that problem, but left the pillowcase underneath ripping every time I turned over. I think the idea is great but the design needs A LOT of work around the head area. Besides the now ripping pillowcase, I love this pillow. It supports my back and belly and prevents me from rolling onto my back accidentally in my sleep. This pillow will work if you cut off the top part of the case and keep the case covering only the sides. Then cut a regular pillowcase so it's open on both ends and slip it over the pillow to the top. Since you have to do this to the pillow I do not think it is worth $60.",3

"Fisher-Price Precious Planet Portable High Chair Cover, Blue","This highchair cover is great - covers all the gross parts of restaurant highchairs so I don't have to worry about wiping the chair down with wipes.  Not that bulky, and easy to clean.  The loops on the front for attaching toys are great too.  My only negative comment is that the slits for the highchair straps are a little too small, and it is sometimes difficult to get the clips on the straps through.",4

Fisher-price - Made By Me - Mess Free Finger Paints,"The concept is wonderful...especially for my daughter with special needs.

"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","I spent a lot of time researching different car seats before I settled on this one. This seat has almost all of the features I was looking for. The only thing it didn't have was LATCH which I found to be unnecessary anyway. One of the most important factors contributing to its high rating is the comfort level. My daughter (who is 5) tried out many seats, and this one is by far the most padded. A lot of the other seats she tried just had a thick layer of fabric, whereas this one actually feels soft and cushy. She has spent 2 hours in it on several different occasions with no complaints. I also love that the armrests fold up if needed, it makes it really easy for her to buckle herself up. It also sits very securely in my car. It leaves me feeling that my daughter is safe when she is in it, and you really couldn't ask for much else. When I first saw the picture of it I was a little wary. The pattern seemed a little too busy for my taste. But, since it had everything else I wanted I decided to give it a try. I am very pleased to say that it looks a lot better in person. I couldn't be more happier with this car seat.",5

Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"At 4 months my son developed a love/hate relationship with our velcro swaddle blankets and miracle blankets. He wanted/needed to be swaddled in order to fall asleep but he'd consistently wake up 30 or 40 minutes into his naps and get super frustrated that he couldn't move his arms so he would fight until he busted out of the swaddle (at this time we were also trying to transition him into his crib from the Rock and Play and I think being flat in the crib would give him more leverage to break out). His arms would flail and/or he'd get cold and he wouldn't be able to get himself back to sleep. We tried swaddling with one arm out to slowly wean him from the swaddle but he was sleeping terribly. We tried sleep sacks but I don't think he felt secure enough to be able to fall asleep, or if he did, his naps were just as short.I read about the Magic Sleepsuit and decided to give it a try. We saw improvements from the first time he wore it. By the second day his naps were back to being two hours (I can time when he'll wake down to the minute!) and his night sleep has improved as well. We finally have him sleeping in his crib and we're on a consistent schedule. I'm already dreading having to wean him off the suit but I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.Also, from the other reviews I was concerned about it being too hot going into summer but so far I've found it to be very breathable and have been able to regulate his temp based on what we dress him in under the suit.",5

"Dream On Me Elora Collection Toddler Bed, Cherry","I was very pleased with this toddler bed. For starters, all of the reviews about how difficult this thing is to put together are TRUE! This thing is a complete NIGHTMARE! But with that being said, it can be done and is not impossible. When I received my bed, all parts were there and in good condition. A little dusty and slightly scratched, but still fine. Some of the pieces I felt did not fit properly, but I went ahead and used then without altering them and the bed turned out completely fine. And for the lady who said she could lay on the bed, TOTALLY TRUE! This is a cheap but sturdy bed. Me and my husband wanted to see if it would hold our weight, so  for 3 minutes, this bed held myself (130lb) husband (180lb) baby (32lb). We were all laying down and had no problems, however I did not want to push it so after a few minutes I got off and let them finish story time without me. In the end, I am super happy with my purchase. Very very cheap, good and sturdy quality.",4
Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode,"So far I've been impressed! We have a large home and I'm happy that I get clear reception from the basement all the way to the second floor. LOVE the talk feature, that I can let our child know that I'm on my way. Also nice to know the temp in the room! Very pleased to far!",5

"GroVia Organic Cloth AIO Diaper, Vanilla",Looove how it fit on my 32lbs 38inches tall guy. It look so trim under his jeans like he was wearing a disposable diaper and it can hold a lot of pee. It washed well (my son never does his #2 in the diaper so I don't know about the staining issues)and dried fast in one drier. No red mark ever. I would like to have more of these diapers,5
Britax B-Ready Lower Infant Car Seat Adapter,I bought this for my britax chaperone car seat.. So I can put my newborn on the bottom of my b-ready stroller.. I love it! It's so easy to interchange !! Def would recommend to a friend,5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","This is a very durable stroller, easy to assemble and very intuitively designed (Britax must have asked a lot of moms in focus groups what they liked about strollers!).  My only criticism is that for the $400 price tag, I think Britax should include the second stroller seat for free instead of charging another $120.This highly adaptable stroller is designed to be configured 14 different configurations. The stroller can handle one child or two, but you have to buy additional accesories to hold two.  The top seat is for babies of at least 6 months old and up to 55 lbs.The under-seat storage basket allows ample space for diapers, baby needs or shopping bags, and you can buy an extra storage device which attaches on to the stroller (not really needed, plenty of storage here!).This stroller is also in-line double stroller with the BRITAX B-READY Second Seat (sold separately for around $120). The Second Seat is appropriate for newborns up to 35 pounds. The stroller can fits an infant car seat with top seat, infant seat with second seat, top seat with second seat, and even second seat with bassinet. It also fits two infant car seats-great if you have twins!The stroller even has a four-point suspension! There are foam-filled rubber tires which helps provide a smooth ride (best I have seen so far). The stroller's adjustable handlebar and grip is comfortable and is at a good angle for pushing. The stroller even has a soft head pad and a retractable sun canopy with a vent window.It's easy to fold this stroller.  The stroller folds with both the top and second seat in place. The single-step brake is very use to use.  There is a clear red/green indicator which allows you to easily lock and unlock both rear wheels with one foot.There is also a large, under-seat storage basket accessible from all sides. The adult cup holder is conveniently located on the side of the frame.  This stroller seems to have all the little details covered.I have owned some high quality strollers, but this stroller is the sturdiest, most intuitive, well ""thought out,"" and adaptable transport system I have used.  I just wish Britax would add the second seat into the package without any additional charge.",5
Munchkin Travelware Disposable Bibs - 24 Pack,"Honestly, thought I would use these while going out to restaurants but they're more of a nuisance than anything.Convenient for sure (when you have time to plan) but just not practical in a working parents world.",2
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"I purchased a moby for baby wearing but after trying that, it seemed easier to invest in a simple carrier.  This one does the trick for very little investment.  My baby is just over 13lbs and is 6 weeks old, I anticipate being able to use this for a few months.With any backpack, the weight is heavy from baby's weight, so I wouldn't wear this for more than an hour at a time.  I am also petite so baby sits closer to my chin than others would probably wear it. It is hard for me to cook or lift much with baby so high up.  I could definitely fold laundry and vacuum with this on.  It is simple to put together and am glad I spent less than 20 to try this type of style carrier.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"This is THE bouncer chair to have.  This chair saved us the first 5 months of our daughter's life.  She had reflux, and sometimes, this chair was the only place she could sleep or would not cry.  I almost cried myself when she outgrew it.  The seat sling is deeper than some of the other seats on the market, which makes it seem safer to me...I also liked that the activities and music were bright and happy.  Also, The activity bar removes so easily when you don't want to use it.  Now that she has outgrown it, I have carefully put it away in the event that we have another baby.  I can't be without this chair!  If you are confused about which bouncer to buy or register for, don't be.  THIS IS THE ONE.",5
Performance Carrier Color: Charcoal Black,"So the verdict is still out on the Ergo. Baby is 8 weeks old and we've managed to use the Ergo a handful of times. I have a feeling we may like it better once the baby is older, but for a newborn/young infant, it's not been ideal for us. Using it with the infant insert is a bit tricky and it becomes incredibly bulky. Baby seemed OK, but it was very hot and uncomfortable for me as the person wearing it. I stopped using the infant insert once baby had more head/trunk control, but even then she didn't really care for it and it never felt terribly secure. It works, so maybe it's just my baby. That said, the carrier does a great job at distributing weight on your hips, so is pretty comfortable for the user. I also really like the little hood and storage pockets.If you're going to get this, get it with the intent of using it once the baby is a bit older and can spread his or her legs around your body. I would NOT recommend the infant insert with this product as it's just not comfortable or functional.",3
"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months","I do love this wrap, I didn't give it all the stars though because it does still hurt my back when my baby is in it.  I have a big baby though 6 weeks old-12lbs.  Easy to use if you watch the videos on youtube.  I had to do it several times but now I have it down.  Make sure you put it on tightly!!",4

Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"Do not waste your money on this pillow! I am highly disappointed after receiving and using it. I had high hopes that this would solve my sleeping discomforts, based upon the reviews. However, it is nothing like what the positive reviews say. It is fairly flat and should be stuffed MUCH more, especially for the price. Since it is flimsy, it moves way too much, and I am constantly having to readjust it. I have had to use several other pillows with it, and it continues to flatten more every day. I am seriously debating whether to return this product because of my disappointment. Try another pillow, if you are looking for quality - this is NOT a good one!",1

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I agree that these bottles are the best on the market!  I used them full time with my son, who is not out of bottles and I fully intend to use them again for my baby on the way!  All peices are very durable.  I love how you are able to interchange peices for these bottles.  I was able to use the bottles as my son's toddler cups when he outgrew nipples!  Not extra cups needed, just got the fittings separately for the cups!Unique and conscious design!  These were well thought out by PARENTS just like us!",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","With my first child, I was ignorant and didn't really research the stroller/carseat combo. I just went with what a lot of my friends and others had in my area. BIG mistake!!! I hated my graco travel system from day one. I thought it was fairly easy to put together (nothing like my B-ready which was so easy even at 8 months pregnant). My toddler loves this stroller!!! We mostly have used our umbrella stroller from the time that she could (I hated my graco that much), but love how high she sits up. We don't have to take her out just see animals at the zoo. I love how it folds up and is easy to unfold. I can't wait to get my newest one into it and try out my second seat!!! The only draw back I have found is that there is no travel bag to protect it when traveling, since we do a lot of traveling I will have to keep looking for one.",5
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,  (Pack of 2)","I purchased these wipes as well as the double sided fleece wipes for my daughter. I use these wipes to wash her bottom when she urinates. The double sided fleece wipes work better for poop diapers. I have also used the cotton wipes to wipe her face and hands if they become sticky.I do not recall if I had any problems with them repelling water in the beginning but I don't think so. These wipes have gone through many washes and I do not use fabric softener on them. We use cloth diapers and I know that if we use fabric softeners on our cloth diapers, they will start to repel water and leak. I did wash the wipes prior to their first use as well.I feel that these wipes were worth the money spent and I like that I am not contributing to waste.",5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","This is just so cute in person, just what I was looking for a gift for a baptism present. Thanks-",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My wife really loves this, and chose it over the Boppy.  She liked it because it has the added back support and likes it a lot.  The one problem I had with it is the construction of the padding under the cover.  When we took it out of the bag it came in, it smelled like straight gasoline!  We decided to give it a try, and removed the cover and aired it out a little for a few days.  It subsided and was MUCH better.I think it has to do with the glue they use to put together the padding under the colorful cover, and the put it in the plastic display packaging before it has the chance to air out properly.  Either way, it works great after we got the smell off of it.  We are very particular about using clean and hypoallergenic items for the baby, so we would not have kept it unless we felt it was safe.I would recommend this to a friend, but I would also recommend they air it out before having it around kids.",4
"Badger Basket Portable Bassinet N Cradle With Toybox Base, Pink Waffle Ruffled","The bassinet had no hardware with it and we had to contact the manufacturer to obtain that - there was no cost, just inconvenience. The price versus quality rates this as 3 stars in my opinion.  The canopy stay crooked - flimsy materials.  The sheet is too coarse feeling for a newborn baby.  It will suffice for one baby for a couple of months, but if this would be needed for more children, I would have returned it.",3
Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"Returned from a trip with some gastric issues and hurt my upper back at the same time.  Sitting in the normal position for long periods made my legs fall asleep and my back spasm.  This caused me more gastric distress leading to panic attacks.  As the hype about this product claims, one's business is done more quickly in the &#34;Squatty&#34; position.  It also kept the pressure off the whatever nerves my back was bothering while sitting.  It makes for an all around more comfortable toileting experience. I will continue to use this because in our fast paced world getting it done faster will be an efficiency and health benefit.",5
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),"These liners are not good! I bought these specifically to protect our baby's cloth diapers when he has to use heavy-duty diaper cream- they do not do the job well. They are rough, tend to bunch up, and tear easily, resulting in diaper cream all over the diapers. Great. We had another brand before this (I can't remember which brand) and they were much, much better. I strongly recommend buying a different brand.",1

My Brest Friend Inflatable Travel Nursing Pillow in Green Paisley,"I purchased the original Brest Friend pillow...(which I would give 10 out of 5 stars by the way).  I was unable to use my original one for a few days, and ended up with extremely sore nipples, and was ready to stop nursing!  Reminded me of the early days before I bought the first pillow.I purchased the travel pillow as a back up, and for traveling on very long flights.OMG, it's just as good as the original !  Easy to use, easy to carry, just love it. Extremely easy to fill up.  Takes less than a minute.  You definitely don't need a pump!Makes breast feeding so much more enjoyable.  Great price too!Update 16 June 2013:  I just traveled from the East Coast of the U.S. to Northern Africa.  I was able to use the pillow in the airport terminal, but unable to use it on the plane.  The seats were just not wide enough to support the pillow.  I had an empty seat next to me, but it still did not work out.I am still extremely pleased with the pillow, and may like it better than the original pillow! I keep one in the baby's room, and one in the living room.I would recommend this to any new mothers who are breast feeding, and want to enjoy it. I'd also suggest you take it (or the original) with you to the hospital.  Regular pillows just don't get the job done without a lot of discomfort!",5

Yesterday I walked through a small patch the stickers. One of the back tires went flat before I could get back to our car. I had to carry the baby, hold onto my 5yo, and push the stroller. I fixed the back tire, just to wake up this morning with the front tire flat from a slow leak as well.If I had been out hiking we would have been in a bind. I highly suggest keeping a small tire pump, and maybe an extra tube with the stroller.",5

He uses both ends of the banana and he likes to knash on the bristle end as his teeth are working through his gums.  It is silicon and I keep it in the freezer so he gets the cold on his gums too.

Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I've owned these for three years now and have had no problems. We occasionally will pick up on the neighbors conversation (they must be on the same frequency as us) but we just switch channels and we're fine. I have no problem with static. Maybe we got lucky? I have had the battery die on us several times without realizing it, so a warning light would be nice. Also, the on/off button has become difficult to turn on one of the units. This just happened recently and I'm not sure why. These are minor complains though. Overall we've really liked these monitors.",4

Boba 4G Baby Carrier (Kangaroo),I love wearing my baby in this carrier. It has good back support and comfortable straps.  My baby has fit inside comfortably now from 14lbs up to 17lbs.

Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"As PPs have stated, this feeder is in 3 separate  pieces for ""easy"" cleaning. The BSF is very durable feeling and the plastic bits are easy to rinse off and throw in the dishwasher. It is a bit heavy, but not excessivley so. The mesh pouch also seems durable and is not as difficult to clean as other similar products. I soak mine in hot water for 15 or so minutes then finger rub the debris off/out before machine washing it. There are seams along the inside and at the ring of the pouch and most debris seems to get caught in the seam allowance. It is easy for baby to grasp and hold and the trouble it takes to clean it is well worth the enjoyment he gets from it. I highly recommend this product over similar ones.",5

"Lifefactory 9-Ounce Glass Bottle, Raspberry","I was torn between Life factory and the Pura stainless sippy for my 11 month old son. After several days of research there was only one thing I could do. Get both and see which one was better for transitioning my son from bottle to sippy. After using both for 3 to 5 months, I can clearly say that I like these better but the Pura sippy is better for transitioning because it has a silicone spout. My son took to the Pura Sippy right away but would not use these until he was fully comfortable with a harder spout at 13 months. Since my son is now fully comfortable with harder spouts, I have stopped using the Pura. The main reasons why I like the Life factory better than the Pura are:1. Very minimal leakage. I can give my son this bottle and not worry. Since the Pura has a silicone spout, if dropped upside down, the spout will open and leak. I also went out and bought all the harder Avent spout that is compatible with the Pura and it all leaks. The Avent spout has a small hole at the top and it will leak from there.2. Life factory makes a screw top cap that fits this sippy. Awesome for travel or mixing formula. Pura does not.3. Comes with the Sleeve! With the Pura, you must buy them separately and don't try using them w/o it. The stainless gets super hot and cold depending on the liquid. I put WARM milk in it and it felt hot. I was quite surprised.4. Has OZ markings on the outside of the sleeve. It's on the inside of the Pura. Not so easy to see.5. I like the look and the ease of the Life Factory. Just screw the spout to the bottle and your done!There are a couple of annoyances with the Life Factory sippy. The bottle opening is slightly bigger than the scoop that comes with the formula so a little bit of powder can get on the bottle. I'm pretty good at it now so it's not a big deal. Another thing is that the sippy gets very heavy when filled with liquid. This will obviously happen because it's glass. Pura also gets very heavy. It doesn't bother my son so I am okay with it.I read a review that says the liquid is hard to get out of this sippy. I haven't had this issue. You just have to make sure you pinch the slit open on the valve and insert it loosely into the spout. Then make sure you don't over tighten the spout to the bottle.In my opinion, if your child is okay with a harder spout, Life Factory is the way to go!***If you are transitioning, you might want to try the Pura for a couple of months since it has the silicone spout. I also found another sippy that my son took to right away and it helped him get comfortable with a hard spout. It's thegreen sprouts 7 Ounce Sippy Tumbler, Green. ***",5
"Baby Teether Ball, Assorted Colors","As other people have mentioned this toy looks a whole lot like a dog toy. So? It's great for teething and for general hand eye coordination growth. We bought this when our baby was 4 months old and it was an instant favorite. She can use it in the car seat, on her stomach and on her back. When I'm not able to pass her a new toy, I tell the big kids ""give her her puppy toy, it'll make her happy."" Smiles from the big kids who think that's hilarious, and smiles from the baby.

Dreamer Design Ditto Jogger Lite - Red/Gray,"This stroller is awesome.  We actually didn't buy it from Amazon, we bought it second-hand from another lady that used it for 4 years before us.  We've had it for 2 and it is still in great shape and I will continue to use it for several more!If you are concerned that it won't work for infants, don't be.  The seats lay back really far, and with some towels rolled up to keep baby supported and snug, I used it only days after giving birth.  I was even able to keep the other seat upright for my then 18 month old.We have pretty crappy roads and sidewalks here, and the inflatable tires are SO NICE.  I've had several strollers with different sizes of wheels, and even one with the big wheels but with hard tires, and they don't compare at all.  I just had an innertube go flat and need a new one, but that is the only maintenance it's needed in all six years.  It's a great investment for all the years of use you'll get and you'll have a fairly good return when you resell it when you are done with it.  (We paid $80.)It also folds up pretty well.  The first time I took it apart, it took a while to figure it out, but now I can do it in less than a minute.  It fits nicely in the back of the minivan with the tires off and folded up.",5
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter For Single Strollers,I love our BOB Triathlon jogging stroller.  I hated when we were going someplace that might involve our daughter eating and we took the Graco just because it had a snack tray.  We bought the kit only for the snack tray but it really sits way too high for any infant. I realize it was integrated into the design of the infant seat carrier but the tray could have been designed to attach differently and be much lower.  Now we look silly while we boost our daughter with a blanket when she is eating.,3
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","These do the job, but we prefer the Imse Vimse.  We have found that with those if they are just wet and not soiled, you can put them through the wash and reuse them.  The Bumkins do not make it through the wash so must be thrown away whether they are soiled or not.",3
Puj Snug - Ultra Soft Spout Cover (Aqua),This is a flimsy cheap piece of foam.  It does not stay on the spout.  It is pointless and probably costs 2 cents to make.  I was extremely disappointed.  Save yourself from wasting your money and get the Skip Hop whale.  That is a solid item with a tie to secure it.  Love that product.  Hate this one.,1
"7 A.M. Enfant Stroller Hand Warmers for Parents and Caregivers, Cafe/Beige","must have for winter, easy on and off, great warmth, i highly recommend. yes i do, i most certainly do",5
The First Years Extra Tall Decor Gate,"Bought one, worked so well, bought another.  Very attractive.  That is the first thing visitors say and then how well it works.  I have a 40 pound energetic puppy and she has not been able to move it.  She behaves so much better if she is in the same room with me.  It works as well to keep out as well as to keep in.  Put puppy on the outside of the gate to wash kitchen floor.",5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"Comfortable, safe, durable and hands-free.  What more could you ask for?!",5
"UPPAbaby Vista Bassinet Stand, White","I wasn't sure after reading some other reviews about this stand, but i was happy that i decided to buy it.i like that it was easy coming out of the box and its all one peice, no putting anything together, which saves time.the stand sets up and your able to put boxes or storage bins underneath the bassinet so you have quick access to the important stuff.being a new parent, still working out what to put in those boxes, but so far so good. The latch system is easy to put in and take off, so i don't foresee any problems.would buy again",5
"Baby Fanatic Team Color Bibs, Chicago Bears, 2-Count",Bought these bibs for my baby girl.  GO BEARS  Good packaging and they look to be from good quality materials.,5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","The seat is amazing, It has a great fabric and it's so supportive. My kid looks snug as a bug in it. I have bought both my recaro seats from amazon and both seats are amazing.",5
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,I got this as a gift and thought what a great ideal. boy was i wrong i used it twice and the shower stopped working. The tub was to short and cramped my newborn. I took it back and got another one and I got to use that one 3 times and found my self returning it the shower stopped workin. It was a good idea but not made good.the baby keep slidin off the sling. So i just got acheaper but better tub. i called the company to tell them about the tub. save your bucks...,1
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"I bought this monitor for my second child after not having a video monitor for my first.  I loved the fact that it could rotate around a room.  I hated spending almost $200 for a monitor, but this thing is amazing!  I have children that do not sleep, and being able to see them has been so helpful for every day monitoring and also for sleep training. I love being able to zoom in and out and move the angle as needed when the baby has moved. I bought a Summer monitor on purpose because my audio only monitor was Summer, and the customer service was amazing - they replaced my broken audio monitor for free!  Today, my video monitor stopped working (it is one year old), and after calling them, we had it fixed within ten minutes.  They are amazing!  This monitor has been a must-have item for me!",5
RLR Laundry Treatment (Pack of 5),Sometimes microfleece is just the pits. Or it smells that way anyway. I've had some serious funk problems with my pocket diapers in the past but the RLR treatment really does get all of the funk out. Drop in a ball with your diapers (already washed). Then run 2-4 cycles until water runs clear. Dry and you are good to go.,5
"South Shore Precious Collection Changing Table, Royal Cherry","To be fair, the product has ample storage space, deep drawers and is a good height, but it came in a million little pieces that we had to pay someone $100 to put together. It took him three hours to do and it is still a bit shaky--drawers don't slide in all the way and come unhinged easily. It is functional for now but I can't wait for a good excuse to throw it out.",3
"7 A.M. Enfant Le Sac Igloo Extendable Baby Bunting Bag Adaptable for Strollers, Grape, Medium","I currently use this bunting on a Britax B-Ready with my 11 month old.I love the color (denim) it's gorgeous, and it is very nice and warm.I live in NY and this is great...I don't have to over dress my baby. When I take him out of the car seat wherever I go, I will take off his insulated coat before putting him in this or else he will over heat. He will usually be wearing a long sleeve shirt onesie, and a chunky cable knit sweater or similar.I like that if I'm out shopping I can unzip on both sides all the way down so he is not too warm.Purchased the size large and it's got plenty of room for him to use up until the end of the cold winter season.",5
Spill Proof Snack Buddy,I got it for My 19 months old son who loves small snacks when he is on his car seat. He cried since he wasn't able to grab the snack. The lid is easy to take off. The cup ended in his toy box.,2
Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle,"Excellent for the teething baby in your life!!! Easy hold, sterilizes along with there other teethers!!I would recommend it to anyone!!!",4
Summer Infant Baby Touch Boost Digital Color Video Monitor,This is a great monitor. I love the zoom and scan features as well as the talk feature. I saw some reviews say the power and talk button were too close. I have not had a problem with that.The only thing I am not happy with is the battery life. Some days it is dead before the end of the day. And that is even shutting it off when my daughter isn't sleeping and only using the camera to just check on her and shut it back off.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,This is by far my daughters (7 months) favorite toy. It took her about 5 minutes to figure it out and she hasn't stoped since. This item is built very well and is very sturdy. I'm happy I made this purchase. Thank you Fisher Price.,5
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"This has been really convenient for potty training, but the construction is flimsy. The seat folds out in 4 pieces when my 35lbs son sits on it, the seat sinks inward toward the toilet. More than once, one of the gaps has folded in and pinched him. I also have to hold on to him because it feels like the seat is going to collapse into the toilet. Maybe it would be good for a lighter child, but didn't work for me.",3
TY Beanie Baby - SMOOCH the Kisses Bear,"I got this as as little gift for my boyfriend and needed to ship it to his house because we wouldn't be able to be together on our year and a half. He loved it and it looks really nice on his shelf, not too girly either so it's a great gift for anyone :)",5
"Buggygear Heart Hook, Red/Silver","This is a great carry hook, not to mention cute!It's carried groceries on my stroller, packages at the mall and my extra toy bag for my children. I find it very useful and easy to use.",5
Snoozeshade Original Deluxe Sunshade and Baby Sleep Aid for Single Strollers/Joggers/Prams,I live in Spain where people like to peek in and touch your baby so I was excited to receive the snoozeshade. Not only does this item keep the sun out but it keeps unwanted hands out also! I love this and have recommended it to others already !,5
Kids Travel Organizer BLACK,"The right price for a highly functional caddy. We use it on the floor between the front seats in our ancient Previa van - keeps our ice scraper, road atlas, paper towels, etc. all nicely organized and a great place to shove extra stuff during road trips.",5
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"great for kids... and babies little play at the living room. I love this product, def worth the money...Great product",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This monitor serves its purpose, but mainly when plugged in. I can't get much more than 4 hours out of the battery when unplugged. From experience I don't like to recharge or plug in a monitor until the battery is fully exhausted.  Doing so with this monitor is inconvenient as I'm up every 2-4 hours with baby & focusing on recharging a monitor is the last thing on my mind.  There is also no zoom or ability to move the camera if baby moves.  I only saved about $50-75 with this monitor & wish I had spring for the monitor with better features, albeit more expensive, it would have been worth it.",3
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","The baby loves this.  (2 months)  She isn't quite into the hanging toys yet since she is still working on hand eye coordination.  But, once she discovered the mirror and made a few kicks on the piano, she had a blast.We limit the time to avoid over-stimulating her since that seems to be the only reason she'll cry when using it.",5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","I love this thing!!!  I love my new toy.  I have a two year old and had a audio baby monitor.  The audio one drove me nuts because I could hear what she was doing but most of the time I was still thinking """"what is she DOING!?"""" I just couldnt figure it out.  Was she awake? Jumping in bed?  Sleep talking?!  So I got a video one.  I picked this one because I read a review of a fellow picky mom and she loved it.  I picked this one because my girl is a light sleeper.  I needed the infared night vision.  Some others say they have a night light that you have to leave on to see at night...not true night vision.  Screw that.  So I got this one from amazon today and its great.  The picture is awesome.  I can see her breath.  See her blinking.  I love that I can move the camera around.  I just put it on the wall above her crib.  Ran the cord around so she couldnt get ahold of it.  I love that I dont have to worry about batteries dying because you can plug in both pieces.  The range is far.  My house is 2100 sq feet and it reaches far into the yard.  You wouldnt want to be farther away from your baby then the range anyways.  I put up a picture of her in her crib.  I took the pic with a tablet so its grainier then in real life.  Its pretty sharp in real life.",5
12 pack - Bum Genius One-Size Microfiber inserts with snap down design,My daughter in law loves these as a enviromentally friendly way to get thru the potty training period.  They are great for when the child is diapered without pants.,5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Great product! Sturdy yet soft, great back support, love the colors. My child can carry it by himself. Love it. Recommend it.",5
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,it has a handle on it and a shoulder strap too.. a little hard to carry and when it came off the plane the zipper was broke.. but we were able to fix it before the flight home and it made it,4
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,"Out daughter suffers from sleep seizures, usually in waking state.  Hiccups are a precursor to a potential seizure for her.  This monitor is crystal clear with its sound, so sensitive we can hear her breathing during the night.  No background static as you turn the volume up.  We use this in conjunction with a video camera that we can peek at to see her movements if we hear a noise.  Choose not to go with a video baby monitor as many of them turn off automatically after a minimal amount of time.  Our camera and this monitor is on till we choose to turn them off.  Hope this helps and good luck.",5
"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","I bought this potty for my 7 month old at the time. She was 20lb and couldn't reach the ground while sitting on it. She can sit on her own comfortably if I put her on. I read reviews before purchasing and I agree that the back of the hole in the potty is more narrow than the Baby Bjorn and she doesn't fall though. It is very easy to clean and I love that front because my daughter can hold on to it, and the back has a nice support. We've been using it for a month now and we are very happy. The price is competitive also. I definitely recommend it.PS: I suggest buying the Potty book, I keep it next to the potty and it's a good distraction for times when baby wants to get off too early.",5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch",I love these bibs. Lovely quality and stylish with various uses. I now buy these for friends when they have a baby and everyone loves them.,5

"Munchkin Scoop Drain and Store Bath Toy Organizer, Blue","It's convenient and easy way of picking up toys.  Yes, it's not too big, maybe slightly bigger would have made it even better, but I'm content.  Saves time on cleaning up and maintaining tub free of toys.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I purchased this bra and have been pleased with design. It is very adjustable. I like being hands free while I am pumping.,5

"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog",Great blanket to cover eyes without covering nose or mouth for our light sensitive baby. Excellent for snuggle baby blanket.,5
"Kushies Waterproof Bib with Sleeves, Blue Circle, Infant","My son insists on feeding himself, which means that everything from head to high chair gets covered.  This bib covers most of that area and saves his clothes.  It's easy to wipe clean after.  My only complaints are that the Velcro at the neck is too easy for him to undo, the sleeves don't have cuffs so food rolls down his arm, and there's no side/back coverage, which is where he likes to wipe his hands.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, White, Mesh",this is a great item.My friend just loved it and the item provided a great support for the baby and it is very easy to use,5
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Beautiful Black White Flower and Dot, 13 Piece",I received this bedding set as a gift from my mom off my baby registry.  I put it on the crib a couple nights ago and it is really nice.  The quality seems really good for the price.  The pattern is very cute and the pink trim is the perfect amount of accent.,5
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier Giraffe,"I really love the concept of this toy/pacifier. And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",3
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,I had a problem with charging the monitor but they sent me another adaptor and it's been great since then. Excellent customer service.,5
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"This pump has been awesome in every regard! I've used it from the time my milk came in, to pumping daily while on leave from work, to working full-time.  So many people made me nervous about not having an electric pump for work, but I had a hard time justifying the cost of an electric one when I was so successful with this pump.  When I returned to work full-time, it was often stress or nerves or just how far along I was with nursing that affected my supply, but I never did buy an electric pump and I never had to supplement with formula.  I'm still nursing full-time 9 months now and even though I ended up quitting work, I still occasionally pump and would recommend this pump to EVERYONE!  Avent is a great company to call and they are willing to replace parts free of charge - they've redesigned how the pump attaches to the bottle and the pump is perfect now!",5
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,"I have the Zanzibar valances and lamp in my son's room so I was excited to recieve this bedding.  I live in Michigan and our winters are cold.  I was hoping the comforter blanket would have been thicker and warmer.  It is a thin fleece blanket with a cute design.  Great for fall and spring, but I question if it is warm enough for winter.  The sheet is clever.  It is fitted on one side so that it cannot ride up or be kicked off.  I like that given I often have to tuck my 2 year old in again after he falls asleep.  The design does have a lot going on but it is cute for a little one.",3
"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln","I searched long and hard for a car seat that would fit rear facing in my 2006 VW Beetle while still allowing room for a passenger to sit in relative comfort. This is the winner!  A passenger that is 5'7"" can still sit with a few inches to spare. This is a small price to pay when faced with the alternative of acquiring another vehicle.This seat also functions well. It is extremely easy to use, pleasant to look at, and comfortable. I will be purchasing another one for the larger family vehicle because its just that great!",5
"Kids Line Valance, Fleur",Exactly as described and nothing wrong with it at all,5
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Lavender Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"This bedding set is excellent. The bed skirt, the sheet, the blanket. Everything fits nicely on a standard mattress and standard crib. It washes easily and the color holds.I've received many compliments on the color and how warm and inviting it is. Baby loves it Just cannot go wrong with this bedding set.",5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"I spent the extra money and bought this in white because I'm bright-children's-colored ""plasticked"" out. The rubber grips keep it from slipping. It's very sturdy and safe, cleans easily, and not an eyesore. It's only worth the extra money if you care about keeping your house from looking completely like Romper Room. :)",5
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","This is our first baby monitor, however, given all the issues our friends have had with other monitors (Summer Infant and Motorola), we are happy we purchased the Samsung SEW-3037W.  Everything works as described and the picture quality is what's most impressive.  It's so easy to use which is a plus.  We have tried all the features and have fallen in love with it.",5

"Re-Play Divided Plates, Aqua, Green, Orange, 3-Count","Love these plates! It's great for keeping food separate: carrots and broccoli in one part, protein in another and a starch or apple sauce in the third! They are durable and dish washer friendly.",5
"OXO Tot Plate, Green","My husband has a bad tremor in his right arm/hand and limited use of his left hand.  I got this plate for him because he kept spilling food off the side of his plate.  And this plate worked fantastically!!!!  We can't say enough good things about this plate.  It's the perfect size for our breakfasts, doesn't look childish, is easy to clean, and if your table is clean and free from any crumbs/dust then the plate will not slide around.  Absolutely fantastic.  Thanks so much for this amazing product!PS - I use it too (so we have matching breakfast plates) and it makes eating so much easier and a breeze.",5
Under the Sea Submarine Nursery Wall Sticker Decals,"I am very happy with my ocean decals because they are very bright & colorful. Also, I can move them a few times and they still stick to the wall.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"My 10-month old loves this jumperoo. We got it for her at 7 months and at first had to put an extra play mat under her feet so she could reach, but I think it eventually stretched out and she grew as well. The music and features are great. I also love that this can easily be broken down for storage. My only beef - as others have pointed out - is that the monkey and elephant (which she LOVES) are a little hard to reach and I wish they were on stretchy-cords. Now that my daughter is a little taller, she can pull on the monkey and elephant, but I'm worried that supporting leaves are going to eventually snap in half as I""m not sure it was designed for that kind of tugging!",4
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,Perfect for the kid that loves ELMO if they are little ! the silver ware is very small and kinda akward because emlo is hard to hold ! but my daughter loves them because she loves elmo !,4
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Crib Sheet, Maize","I love these sheets.  They are super soft and cozy and they wash up really well.  They retain their shape, fit our standard size crib mattress, and best of all I love the look on my little one's face as he snuggles down into them when I lay him down for bed at night.I have 2 pairs that I keep in rotation for the winter months, but am considering getting a few more and using them on into spring and summer.  Who doesn't love a cozy bed to sleep in?Now if American Baby only made them in Queen size I'd be in heaven!",5
"Baby Essentials Nylon Baby Backpack, Orange and Grey",I bought this as my son got older and we didn't need to carry quite as many items when we left the house.  This is a great item for the price.  It has alot of space to fit things and insulated pockets to keep bottles cold.,4
Bambinos Tidy Table Tray,"I like this tray very much but I gave 3stars because the clip is not working properly with our table. Our table is 2'' thick and it is too thick to use the clip. This is the reason I was hesitated to buy first time because I saw one of the reviewers was talking about the same issue. I bought this tray just because one of the reviewers answered my question that he/she was not sure how much thick the table should be but the clip is kind of big. I really hoped the clip would be working properly because I loved all other parts of this tray. Even though the clip is not working perfectly with our table, I can still use the clip to hold the tray enough (I am not satisfied, but I can say I like this tray much better than other usual table mats... that's why I didn't return). Another reason that I gave 3 stars is that the center of green tray kind of sticks out. I thought I got a defective one at first, but I bought two of these and both have the same problem. The green tray is not level, so if you put bowls on there, it kind of moves around. the white part is flat-bottomed, only the green tray is not.",3
Soft Baby Pillow Insert,"This is a nice, soft pillow for the little people. It also works for a knee pillow for adults that need the help when sleeping. It washes well also.",5
Prince Lionheart Formula Mixer,"I bought this based on the reviews and I'm overall happy with the purchase. We recently had to switch our baby to a rice starch formula which is thicker and therefore much harder to mix by just shaking. We're also using the Playtex Drop-In bottles, so we can't mix in the bottle...I don't know if that makes the difference, but the only problems I can see is that it does splatter if you don't have a tall enough cup to put it in and it makes alot of foam and bubbles. It will get all the lumps out though which is what I wanted it for.So the conclusion: If you want a small mixer to get out all the lumps and cut the time of preparing bottles, this is for you. Just watch the foam and find something deep enough to make sure you don't get the little splatters it will create.",4
CherryCreek Decals Cherry Blossom &amp; Birds Decorative Nursery/Room Wall Sticker Decals,"Very easy to adhere to wall.  The picture is true to actual color. This comes in sections, so make sure you place the first piece exactly where you want it with keeping in mind the height and width it will come to be.  The template tells you that information.  Be careful with some sections as they can tear.  Although, the quality is excellent.  The finished product resembles a hand-painted mural. Will definately be purchasing others sets for the rest of my house.",5
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"I first bought this product for my baby daughter and was so pleased I ordered a few more, which I gave as gifts.  This was the only thing that would help soothe my daughter, aside from being held.  She suffered from horrible colic for her first 3 months, so we tried everything to help her sleep, and the sweet music along with the soothing ocean scene worked great to calm her.  No matter how long it played, it never got annoying, as other toys that involve music can get after awhile.  It even has the option to switch tunes or listen to the sounds of gurgling water or turn off the sound completely.  It stayed in my daughter's crib until she was old enough to switch to a toddler bed and she never got tired of playing with it.  As she got older, she could turn it on by herself.  It safely attaches to the crib without damaging it over time, as some attachments can do, and is easy to remove and reattach as often as needed, but childproof, so you don't have to worry about your child being able to unattach it.  Nothing about this was complicated and the concept is very simple and very effective.  I was very happy with this product, as well as the price and would definitely recommend this for a baby boy OR girl.  It makes a great shower gift as well, as it is unique enough that you can be pretty sure no one else will give a duplicate, it's versitile and extremely affordable.  This was one of best things we purchased for our baby and one of the best values, too.  I highly recommend this!",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","Our then 2.5-mo LO slept fairly well at night but takes terrible naps. After reading all the reviews on the Woombie I decided to give it a try... and was so hoping this would be the sleep miracle!Well, it IS very helpful. LO hated being swaddled (wanted to move!) so this provided some movement... but she hates that she only has SOME movement. I think if we had started her in the Woombie from the beginning, this would be GREAT. As it is, while it does keep her asleep because of fewer reflexes jolting her awake, she gets super upset when she wakes up in it because she can't move freely. It hasn't helped her short naps, but I think it has made her slightly better at night when it comes to sleeping.All in all, I'm glad we bought it but we're starting it right away with the next baby!",4
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer",Great booster seat.  Only thing is it is a bit tuff to buckle since the strap has to go under each arm rest.  I don't think my 5 year old boy will be able to do it any time soon.  It maybe that our seatbelt is to hard to pull out.  Either way I don't mind strapping him in.,5
Baby and Kids Clothes Laundry Hamper for Sweet Jojo Designs for Pink Groovy Peace Sign Tie Dye Bedding,This was the perfect addition that finished my daughters tye dye room.  With the cover flap that is not shown in the picture she is able to hide her dirty clothes.,5
Umai Authentic UNPOLISHED (RAW) MILK Baltic Amber Teething Necklace,This is a great product. I put it on my 4 month old son and he seems to be much calmer. It didn't help with the drool but I think it helps with the pain of teething. At night and nap time I put it around his ankle. When I forgot one night he actually woke up more frequently and was way more fussy.,5
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","My wife and I love this chair....it is very very comfortable, glides and swivels. We have the ivory chair, it is very nice looking. We really couldnt ask for a better chair for our nursery. It even looks great in the living room. I would highly recommend this chair. No squeaking.",5
Sassy Flutterby Teether Developmental Toy,It's been tough for us to find good teething toys that my son really likes.  He tends to prefer toys that are a lot thinner but likes the cold ones.  This seems to be an oxymoron when it comes to teething toys.  He does really love the colors on this toy and likes to suck and chew on the orange wings but the blue ones are a little too thick for his small 6-month old mouth.  Maybe as a toddler teething he'll like it better.,3
BRICA Bath Kneeler,"There is not much to this kneeler.  It is one piece and has a nice velcro strap to hang it up to dry if it gets wet.  It is plastic coated so it shouldn't get too wet.  It is a little stiff, but I think after a few uses will loosen up.  There is a cute little owl in the corner of the mat.",4
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny","I really do like this bouncer mostly because my son seems to really enjoy it...Or at least he did. We got this when he was about 3 weeks old and he loved it until he was about 4 months...now he doesn't like to be in it very long at all. First, the bird mobile thing is lame. When he was younger it would entertain him if we moved them around but they just hang there and do nothing and are bland in color. It doesn't keep his attention anymore. Second, like everyone else states, you will stub your toes on this thing a lot! Third negative, now that my son is more active at 5 months, he is constantly moving his legs and therefore he bangs his feet on the control box. He doesn't seem to mind but it makes me cringe because it is hard plastic, so I end up putting a small folded blanket on that part to give him some more padding. What I do like is the softness of the product, the music, and vibration. The music and vibration would put my son to sleep every time. I may be one of the few people who likes that the music and vibration shuts off after a while. It saves on the batteries and doesn't jar my son awake when it turns off. The head position pillow thing is rather annoying. I guess it is meant to be adjustable but it always sits really low so I am constantly moving it up when he sits in it. Overall, I like this product but I'm glad I'm not the one who purchased it because the price is steep for what you get. Even if the mobile just moved and was more interactive I think I would give this 5 stars, even if I do stub my toes all the time.",4
"The First Years Gumdrop Bottle Starter Set, Pink/Purple",Cute bottles cant wait till my little girl is born in August 2013. My wife loves them. Thanks a lot,5
"Stephan Baby Infant Boy/Girl Embroidered Christening Bib and Bootie Socks Set, White",Very nice product. I would recommend these items. They washed well and the bib had to be ironed but that didn't bother me.,5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","The bra itself holds the flanges very well, however, it just pushes them against your chest.  When i took it off I could see  the red circles it left from the pressure.  Plus, you can't massage for more milk with this on.  I highly recommend learning how to self-express, I can now get 4oz in 5-7minutes without any gadgets.",3
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss Receiving Blanket, Red Stripe","This was the cutest gift that I gave my newborn nephew, Benjamin! And he looks good in red ! Thank you",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,I bought this brand of bottle after struggling with another brand and following the suggestion of our pediatrician. This is a much better bottle for her and they are so easy to clean! The bottle brush is great too.  We have only used the small bottles yet but I know we will like the large ones when she eats more ounces at one feeding.,5
"Munchkin Corner Bath Organizer, Pink","the idea of this bath toy organizer is better than the product... the suction cups on it are weak and do not hold up. it pretty much hangs by two, and i don't have that many toys... about a third of what is shown in the picture of the product",3
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"I work as an Early Interventionist with babies and young children who are at-risk for developmental delay.  I need a variety of toys which my little clients can use to practice their fine motor and cause-effect skills.  After a baby begins to play with a rattle by shaking it, using a spinning toy is the next play skill that emerges.  The Sassy Developmental Wonder Wheel Suction Toy is a good addition to my toy-collection because:  the suction actually holds the toy in place;  the wheel mechanism moves freely; there are three (3) additional mini-spinners, which also move freely;  the toy can be oriented so the baby can make it spin in two (2) planes -- clockwise/counter-clockwise or toward/away-from the baby.",5
"Luvable Friends Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, White","I ordered two of these.  They are a little roomy, which left enough room for a mattress pad.  They are very soft, and do not shrink when laundered.",5
"Fleurville Lunch Pack, Silver World Flag","My daughter used this for her second semester of Pre-K. The backpack was easier for her to carry than the shoulder strap lunch bag she used before.  It also has pads on the bottom to help it stand. There is an insulated bottle holder on one side and space for food containers on the other side. It can fit a Thermos Funtainer bottle, food jar and snack jar or a bottle, a sandwich container, small bowl and an ice pack. It has a sturdy handle on top and the back straps can be unhooked and stored in a pocket on the back, which has a place to write the child's name.  The pocket on the front is also insulated.  It's not big enough to store large art projects, but it can fit an envelope or folded letter-size papers.This is good for kids who carry lunch, but don't need a big bag to carry books. Since the straps can unhook, you can also attach this bag to another one if you need to use more than one.It's made without PVC or any other toxic materials and it also has reflectors on the front and back for added safety. The description here says it's machine washable, but the company recommends against that. I just clean it with a damp soapy cloth or a wipe.",5
"CoCaLo Sherpa Blanket, Snickerdoodle","So soft and cute! It finishes the 3- piece set with the darling stuffed Giraffe the we also ordered, perfect!",5
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"This product is terrible- I would not recommend it.We bought this to use on our back windshield, to help my poor 4 month old son not have the sun in his eyes during our 1/2 hour morning drive.1) We have a very small (old style Honda Civic) car.  When this was stretched to its largest size, it only blocked a tiny portion of sun. I can't imagine how ridiculous it would be in a larger vehicle.2) More importantly, in a 20 minute drive we had to pull over 4 times to re-suction this to the window.  We almost ended up with a soaked passenger seat because the thing sounds like a gunshot when it flies off the window.3)  We tried suctioning it without stretching it the whole way, and without stretching it at all, and it didn't make a difference, it still didn't stay put.All of that being said, we got our money back.",1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,For the price of this mattress it's great. We purchased this for the portable mini crib even though it suggests nothing bigger than 2&#34;. It works great.,5
Babysight Digital Handheld Color Video Monitor,"I purchased this and returned it immediately because the camera unit became really really hot when plugged in.  I thought it must be a defective unit so I exchanged it for another one.  The second one did the same thing.  Neither unit was in the sun, or under anything. It was hotter than my laptop when the fan is blocked. I had the second one in the living room where I could keep an eye on it.  The camera unit is the part that would be in the room with the baby and it was certainly hot enough to start a fire if it was anywhere near clothes or something flammable!  I returned the second one for a refund.",1

"Pam Grace Creations Zigzag 10 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set, Teal/Lime",Bright & happy colors for a new baby. Gender neutral. Great quality. Rail cover is unique and I have received lots of compliments about it.,5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"Based on previous reviews, I bought two of these at the same time; one for my grandson and one for his cousin. They both absolutely love it. They are 2 months apart, and each one started noticing, watching, and hitting it at about 2-1/2 months old. They love the lights, sounds, and look of this toy. It continues to be a favorite toy for both of them at different ages in development. The price is incredibly reasonable, so if you're looking for a great toy for young babies, this is it!",5
"Sassy Seat Doorway Jumper, 3 Toys","i bought this for my daughter at 4 1/2 months(its recommended for babies 4 months and up) she would never really jump in it so i thought she just wasn't the jumping type. i was sad that i had wasted $35. i continued to place her in it, because she didn't hate it, she would just sort of sit there. well i came across a graco jumper for really cheap so i decided to try it out since ive seen children have so much fun with these....and she LOVED it. she jumps around like crazy in her graco. the way the spring works on the graco is much more sensitive and you dont have to do much to bounce around, with the sassy you do. Also the graco supports on both sides and the back while the sassy only supports one on each side which makes your baby lean toward the side and isn't level. this sassy is more of a bucket seat so your child will also sit very low and my daughter was unable to have her arms out, the graco sits higher and my daughter can play with stuff on the tray. i dont know why sassy even adds those toys to the front when a child can't even grab them. i recommend the Graco Jumpers that come with a tray in front.",1
"Badger Basket Embassy Wood Baby High Chair with Tray, Espresso","Loved the unusual look of this high chair and still do. But it's got a few problems. The whole tray doesn't come out, just the plastic cover. This makes it really hard to put the baby in the seat. And even though that plastic part of the tray is easy to clean, food gets all in the nooks and crannies of the wood part below and is almost impossible to wipe up. Also, we had to put a folded blanket on the back of the chair so the baby wouldn't hit is head on the hard wood. And maybe I'm an idiot, but the buckles don't seem to stay on the straps. They buckle together fine but slip right off the nylon straps.I wouldn't recommend this item. You'd be better off with something padded and functional.",2
Chewable Teething Necklace for Teething Babies or Nursing Moms. Strand of 14mm Dark Blue Beads with 3 Faceted Gray Oval Beads in Center. Cord Is Knotted Between Each Beaded for Added Safety. Soft Silicone Food Safe Beads. BPA Free Non Toxic. Gift Box Included for Easy Gift Giving,"Love the idea of this necklace and my daughter likes it. I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 because I thought the beads were more of a navy blue from the photo, but they are closer to purple.",4
"Rumparooz Cloth Diaper Cover, White Snap",Great diaper cover. I use it for nighttime and it holds all the pee and poop. I don't change my 10 month old during the night so I was really impressed that there have been zero leaks. It's super comfy on my chubby baby's legs and tummy. Nice color and great material. Would highly recommend!,5
Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock,"I didn't like this lock for a number of reason's... #1 when you lifted the toilet to use it, it kept the lid from staying all the way up and would hit you in the back when you used the toilet or you'd have to lean forward. #2 my son would use the arm to pull himself ontop of the toilet. After only 2 months he was able to break the lock off completely. #3 when you remove the lock it leaves the sticky goo on your toilet lid. Now I have to not only buy a new lock but a new toilet seat. ONLY good thing about it was that it did keep him out of the toilet... until he broke it off that is ;) Thank you Safty 1st!",1
"NUK Gerber Graduates Fun Pack Utensils, 8-Count","Nice soft textured handles, good size mouth pieces. Single mould so nothing to come off and be swallowed. Having 4 of each is also good so that there always seems to be a spare. Good all round set of utensils.",4
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","This snack bag is in constant use of my preschooler. I find it pretty expensive, but I am glad I got it anyway. It is easy to clean, dries fast and has not started to smell to far (we have it about 6 months).",5
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","These are hard to beat.

"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Great for the nursery, sounds and projection work well. I did have to return the first unit because the nightlight didn't work, but did so with no hassle. We had a similar unit  that was a different brand that only held up for 2 months. This one also has the added feature of voice activation, we like it!",5
Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack,"I brought this mostly to save my diaper changing cover. When those poos kept on flowing, this was great to slide in and out and not waste diapers and/or mess up the table. It's really big, the size of the entire table, so I cut it down. But it does not leak which is great!",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","Although taller and heavier duty than the initial car seat (Primo Viaggio) it was a slimer fit into the car. We, he, out grew the first one long before reaching either 30lbs or 30in. Reccomend the Diono for the long haul.",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","I REALLY wanted to like this... but it just didn't work for us.  My 3 month old is always breaking out of his HALO swaddle and his Summer Infant Swaddle Me, so I was excited to see this since he couldn't break out of it.  Well, he breaks out of his swaddle because he wants to suck on his hands (then he sometimes needs to be reswaddled in order to get back to sleep).  This item left him unable to get his hands out to suck on them, however, he could still get them to his mouth and would suck on them through the fabric.  This was a huge issue because then he ended up with a soaking wet swaddle blanket... not exactly comfortable.  After the third time I put him in it, he had figured out how to get his fist out right up at the neck.  It made me nervous that he would eventually decide to force his arm through the neck hole and end up in a rather uncomfortable position.With all that said, I think this would be a GREAT product for a smaller baby.  I returned this item and will be sticking with the Summer Infant Swaddle Me.  That seems to work best for us.",2
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural","I use it to travel with my 6 week and 10 lb. baby girl. I take out of the carrier during the flight and she was in the insert all the time.  The only complaint is that it is to hot. and at the end of the trip, she was sweaty.",4

Unfortunately, many employees would use them up before we could get to them.  We put these up on the cabinets we wanted to secure, along with temporary notes.  Now we no longer have to worry about &#34;missing&#34; items, and after leaving the notes up for a few weeks, employees no longer try to get into the reserved supplies!",5

"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","i bought this because it was literally the exact design i had in mind. that being said it is cheap :P im glad my dad got it put together, but it was a hassel and the door hinges dont really allow the door to colse as properly as it should. i am very pleased with it as a whole, and it is a great piece for the price, but if youre looking for a NICE well made piece of furniture, id probably say get it custom made instead :P",3

Susen Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Protect Soft Cap Hat for Baby Children Kids (Pink),Bath time finally became much easier. I really recommend this product to anyone even though it is made out of foam.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this play yard for my daughter to use at daycare. At home I have a basic Graco play yard without any decorations. My daughter instantly preferred this one over the plain one. She actually watches it in wonder from across the room. You can't help but take her over to it and let her play for a while because she loves it so much.The colorful decorations and toys are definitely great at keeping her busy. It folds up and transports easily. It is easily cleaned with a damp soapy cloth and if all else fails you can buy a replacement bag and/or mat affordably ($16 - $21 each). I love this play yard and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a roomy, stimulating environment to keep his or her young one in.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought Sophie for our (then) 4 month old daughter. She absolutely LOVES it! We love Sophie too because it is safe, non-toxic, and so easy to clean! My baby will hold Sophie and ""talk"" to her for hours. She doesn't interact with any other toy like this one. When it's nap time she must have Sophie to hold onto. We will probably be buying a second Sophie in case something tragic happens to the one we have!",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Melodies and Motion Soother,"The description says that it plays up to 18 minutes, but this is true when listening to music only - when using lights and/or motion it will only run for four minutes after which it will automatically shut down.  Obviously, unless your child falls asleep in four or fewer minutes this product is totally useless.  Furthermore, this soother has fewer features than those sold for approximately the same price five or six years ago.  Rather than make a quality product, Fisher Price has elected to give you a cheaper product for the same price.  Cheapness seems to be the only attribute American companies are after these days.",1
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray",I purchased this product for my double BOB. I was concerned about my newborn not having any head support. I have been using this for 3 months and love it! It holds him right in place and he fits great in it. It looked big when I took it out of the box but after I got it and my baby in the stroller it's perfect. The stroller straps fit right through the opening between the head and arm support so the straps are where they should be. The material is great and has held up over a few washes. I love that it's reversible now that it's summer. Would definitely recommend for stroller use.,5
"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery","I was looking for a baby book that was similiar to the one my mom kept for me when i was a baby.  A book with places to record firsts, illnesses, immunizations, etc.  It comes with a nice plastic box too which is nice to store loose papers in.",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna",It fits perfectly and the ease of opening and storing is amazing. Amazons delivery was fast and speedy...I would recommend this to anyone considering a play yard or portable bed.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether Set of 2,"This is such a cute animal and a very durable one as well.  My grand-baby adores it and chews on it daily.  The reason I bought two is that the original one for the older girl finally began to show some wear.  Pretty good to last over 3 years!  She loved it so much, I got her a new one and also one for the new baby.",5

Baby Trend Snap N Go EX Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier,We love the fact that it is universal for all baby seats.  I also like the two wheels in the front for more control and stability,5
"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","To start off let me say I have been a faithful Britax fan after trying out various other brands with my older one.This is absolutely the best built, safest car seat out there for your baby, that said, it does not work for all babies.Only for skinny ones.  I have fraternal twins, both normal sized, one is built slim and long, coming in at the 50% onwt for ht etc, while the other one is at the 85th% or so in wt for ht.  Neither is off the charts or anythingAnyway, the chubbier one, outgrew his 22lb companion seat at close to 8 mo, so I purchased two of these seats toswitch both over to rear facing since I could no longer use the snap n go stroller and appreciated that unlike theconvertible roundabout available 10 yrs ago for my oldest, this one could keep him protected for a long while.Had to buy it sight unseen since it wasn't available locally.The biggest con for me on this seat but it is a deal breaker -- The crotch strap is completely under my chubby little ones butteven with the infant body pillow taken out.  At least it works for my skinnier child.  I called Britax, and they were totally unhelpful,they do not make a longer crotch strap for me to purchase or anything.One more con - This is a giant seat in terms of width. I have two lexus trucks the RX and the LX.  Even on the LX, withtwo of these side by side, I cannot seat someone in the third seat in the middle row.  In the RX, you cannot even installin the middle position and have two people sit comfortably on the sides in the back row.  So the side impact protection comesat a huge cost.I didn't really want to go for a minivan, so I am using this britax  towards the window, and have purchasedtwo more of this car seatSunshine Kids New Radian 80 Convertible Car Seat - SuperCoolfor the middle position.No side impact protection, but I decided that was ok for a middle seat.  The radian also has a top tether forsuper safe installation.  Only issue is that it is a tall seat,(quite a few inches taller than the Britax)so the person in the front seat will be uncomfortable.  The skinny radian permits a third person to sit in the middle orback row of my LX and RX respectively.To summarize, pick the Britax if you need only one seat, don't need a full back seat of seating, and can install as a window side seatin a normal size car.  And absolutely only for a skinny baby.The Radian, you can buy if you want 3 in a row say, or all functioning seats in the back row.  But for rear facing prepare to bevery cramped in front if its in anything but center position.",4
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, Blue",I bought this for my 2 yr old.  We didn't want to go to a toddler bed to save money so we bought this...works great.  He is a crazy sleeper and hasn't been able to fall out of bed.  We'll be using it for awhile!,5
Playtex Baby Binky Most Like Mother Latex Pacifiers: Pink,"I bought these because they say they are most like mom, as I was breastfeeding, I wanted to ensure that he didn't get nipple confusion.  I brought these to the hospital with me and only allowed him to use these, although I was hesitant to let him use any paci at all and I ended up not really letting him use it until he was able to hold it in his mouth without dropping it every five seconds!!  Needless to say, he has only used these paci's since birth and won't take anything else.  They seem a bit large, but it's no bigger than my nipple and that doesn't change sizes, so why should his pacifier!!  He loves it, and I highly recommend for nursing mothers.",5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Get Rollin Activity Table,Absolutely love it!!!!! Defiantly recommended to purchase this item... My child loves it!!!! :) great idea for children under 2,5
"Britax Pavilion G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage",This carseat was very easy to install (much easier that the directions make it seem). It is way more secure and comfortable than the Graco infant seat I was using. The color and pattern are very pretty.  It fits nicely in my car and is very stable.  The latch hooks are really easy to install. I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Getting one for dad's car too.,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I was determined to purchase a comfortable and safe car seat for my 3 yr old.  We looked at the Britax Frontier but after reading reviews on the Graco Nautilus and seeing the great price we chose to try it instead.  After one week I ordered a second one for our 19 month old.  These seats are great!  They are comfortable and well made.  The boys love the little hidden pockets and the cup holders but I like how solid they are and the fact we can use the 5 point harness for quite some time.  Overall a great buy!,5

"Aden by aden + anais Easy Swaddle Blanket, Oh Boy!, Large","These are the best. I bought this for friends who were having a hard time keeping their 4 week old swaddled.

"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10",The quality of the suit is superior and looks identical to the suit the groom is renting for the wedding. When I took the suit out of the box and realized the quality...I was excited!  The zipper tie is also fascinating and very convenient especially for small children.,5
Taggies Soothe and Snuggle Me Sleeper,"I had to return the competitor's version of this so it got this one instead since I could remove all the fabric to wash it. This is a very important to me when deciding on a product. I loved the other one & recommended it to everyone, but now I can say I like this one even better! It is a little more slender so it's easier to fit between the wall & bed. It allows my baby to stretch his legs out. He is 6 mo, btw, & still fits in this. It's very sturdy. The grippers on the bottom stick to the floor good. It has a vibrator & removable cushion. It folds up for easy storage & travel! Love it!",5
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"I got this as a first try at an easy/quick to use hands free system.  So far I have found it works great for me.  I am a large size (F/G cup), and the setup of the regular size out of the package only needed minor tweaking to fit me perfectly.  I have read other reviews where there were complaints about itchy velcro, but I have not experienced any issues with it.  I just try to take care when putting on the halter (have used with and without clothing underneath) and have not experienced any itchy issues.  The neck strap doesn't seem to be needed once I got comfortable with the halter itself and felt more assured that once it was in place it was not going to move, and trust me, once you start pumping it is not going anywhere!My only negative would be that the velcro is really good = read noisy.  My little one startles at the noise if I try to open the halter quickly to remove it.  I've simply adjusted my timing and open the velcro closure slowly to prevent scaring the heck out of him.I'm glad I didn't spend a ton of money for one of the more fitted bustier type hands free systems when this one works like a charm!",4
Jeep Jogging Stroller Weather Shield,"We bought the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Stroller and it fits the stroller well. The reason a lot of people are saying it does not fit is bc they are trying to place the rain cover over the cup holder. In order for it to fit, you need to run the cover UNDER the cup holder and it WILL fit. Works very nicely.",5
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog","This is very cute, it works great. I bought it for my newborn daughter and my 3 year old son loves it!",5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"I am using my husband's account to post this review. I liked this pump until, I like the others, had power reduction in the motor. In my case one side would pump at full steam and the other was pumping at the first speed. I called the 1 800 number and spoke to one of their representatives. Even though the warranty had expired,she express mailed me a brand new pump. Not just the motor an entire new box with everything we had originally purchased. They also included three etra sets of tubing, and extra set of valves, two extra shields and an extra bottle.They also included shipping labels so I could send the pump motor in for thier engineers to take apart and study. Now after the amazing customer service I will make sure to buy Learning Curve products. It nice that they stand behind their products.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Monkey Teether,"We bought this for our son when we needed a teether that he could hold and he LOVES this thing.  The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that it's kind of heavy, and when he flaps his arms and it hits him in the head sometimes it sort of startles him.  This is a great toy, and easy to clean.",4
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),"The idea behind the Snack Trap is fantastic, but as the other reviewers have stated, the lid does not attach securely enough.  I know it is just a matter of time before my little one pulls it off and I'm right back to where I started!",3

"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","I bought this after seeing a friend use it for her little one, thinking it was such a novel idea. We've been using it for about 6 months now and the product has been a great addition to our collection of baby gear. It's very durable and easy to clean. It makes going out to dinner a breeze without having to sanitize the whole restaurant! So far, it's been a great investment.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Maximum recommended weight listed as 96 pounds online In the Amazon description. When the jumper arrived, the maximum weight in the instruction manual is only 25 pounds!!!! VERY disappointed. Our bambini would only be able to use for a few weeks, if that long. Waste of time & money. False advertising.",1
"BESTEK drain stopper hat shampoo cap bath hat shower cap baby shower accessories baby hair shampoo and body wash (with ultra-adjustable hook loop, blue)","There are several of this kind of hat on here and almost all have low reviews due to size. I went with this one because it has the snaps and can be easily altered to adjust for larger sizes (kind of like the hair tie trick to make pants bigger). It is a bit small. My 11 month old's head is large enough and small enough that he's somewhere between the largest and second to largest setting. So I have it at largest. So I drop a star for size.As for how it works? It is awesome. We only have a shower in our home, no bath tub, so washing his hair was awful, he'd scream and get water/soap in his eyes. But I used this for the first time today and it worked great. He didn't even get fussy. He's in that stage where he fights getting dressed and diaper changes, so it was a bit of an adventure to get it on him. I wound up snapping it before putting it on him and then pushing it down onto his head, but I'm sure it'll get easier as I use it more. I'm very glad I bought this, and I'm happy that showers will no longer be awful for him.Edit: My son is now just over 12 months old and the hat still works great for him! And I was right, it's a lot easier to get it on him now.",4
Onya Baby Carrier - Outback - Black,"i love how the mesh material doesn't cause my baby to sweat so much when in it, but i have a big problem with how the mesh irritates my baby's face, arms, legs, and whatever it brushes against. it's quite abrasive, really.another thing to note is the buckle placement on the adult's waist/hip part. i'm not sure if it's just me, but my baby's knee seems to hit or rub against it all the time.otherwise, i think it's a great carrier.",3
Kidco Door Finger Guards,I have been using the door finger gaurds for a few weeks now. They do their job but the adhesive is very weak. I had to use super glue to get them to stick.,4
"Aquatopia Safety Bath Time Easy Kneeler, Blue",A great product - makes bathing baby easier and much more comfortable on your knees and elbow.  I would recommend this to anyone with a baby or child.,5
"Ulubulu Pacifier Set, Pull to Sound Alarm and Mute Button, 0-6 Months","My son loves these pacifiers, but I was quite disappointed when I ordered them from Amazon. To remove the pacifiers from the package you have to snap off two plastic tabs, when I did this I noticed that there was a long piece of hair wrapped around the nipple. I have no idea how it got there but there is no way I am going to use these with him!",1
Fresh N Freeze 4 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 6-Pack,These are ok. The pureed food I put in gets freezer burned on top. They don't close great. I wouldn't buy again.,3
"Infantino Union Ergonomic Carrier, Gray",I desperately wanted to love the Ergo (sport model) with my son and well.... he hated it. He was so smushed & curled up in it and he really didn't like that feeling so I ended up selling it. He liked the Bjorn better since he could have his arms out & it kept him secure but the bigger he got the more it hurt to wear. A few months later I found this one at the thrift store for $5 so thought it would be handy to have since he's getting too big for the Bjorn. I tried it on and WOW. It fit perfectly & super comfortable. I can wear him (11 months & 23lbs or his sister 3 years & 30lbs) very easily and they both love it. It might be harder to adjust for smaller babies but I've never tried that so can't say. It's AWESOME for bigger babies/toddler though!,5
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","Received item and set it up for expectant baby. It looks great and is easy to set up. It seems very sturdy and safe. We will have to see how our son likes it in a couple of months, but it had great safety ratings/reviews.",5
Zo-li Buzz B. Baby Nail Trimmer,I love this product. It does take longer to use but I don't have to worry about hurting the baby.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My daughter sleeps so well in this sleeper.  Such a great buy.  Keeps her at an incline position, which she loves.",5
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","My son was on his way out of a stroller, but still would have needed a rest during big trips. This stroller was so perfect! I was stopped often by people asking about it, and I told them to get this exact model. It is small and light and as easy to use as a typical single stroller. Many sit and stands were bigger and heavier. This one is the one you want!",5
Fisher-Price Take Along Swing- Woodlands,"This is the weakest swing ever.  It states there are five levels of speed, they are all the same, weak and slow.  I was surprised that it would barely rock my 8 pound one month old.  I can't imagine that it would rock her when she grows, it says it has a weight limit of 25 pounds.  I find that hard to believe.  Would not recommend at all.  I returned it.",1
"Beebaba Backpack Diaper Bag with Insulated Bottle Pocket, Eco-friendly Heine Series (Black)","This is a great backpack diaper bag. It helps us be very organized, while still being able to bring what we need. Love it!",5
Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871),"I obviously had bought the camera and monitor first. We had problems with our first camera before ever getting a chance to use it. I figured maybe something had happened causing it to break so I went ahead and bought another camera. Pulled it out of the box and the exact same issue, it powered up for about 2 seconds and then I smelt an electrical fire and it powered down. Total piece of junk.",1
Dream Baby Drawer Catches 3 pack,"For a Mommy who is amazingly precise with power tools and measuring, these were 20 times more difficult to install than they should be. Plus your drawer has to have the right features or they won't fit. Using them is okay, once installed. But I recommend placing them on the side of the drawer that is less accessible to baby's hands, otherwise baby will grab at them. Also, coach your spouse not to slam drawers or these will ruin.",2
"Natursutten 2 Pack BPA Free Natural Rubber Pacifier, Butterfly Orthodontic, 0 - 6 Months","Perfect texture and softness, yet durable.  The closest thing to a real nipple which is why I think my LO took to it (unlike every other pacifier I tried to give her).  The orthodontic shape is the natural shape made when she's sucking for comfort (versus breastfeeding), another reason I think she took to it.  I have 3 of them (2 for home and 1 for traveling) and will easily spend the $9 on more if they need replacing.  I also really like the groove for under the nose so it gives her room to breathe, as well as the size - it's big enough that she can find it in her crib in the middle of the night to self-soothe herself back to sleep.  And because it's soft everywhere, it doesn't wake her up if she rolls over it or turns her face onto it.",5
Boppy Slipcovered Body Pillow,"The Boppy Slipcovered Body Pillow costs $55 with PRIME membership mailing. Overall, an attractive pillow. I found it too soft for my body needs firmer support. Also, the slipcover could have been eliminated since it's challenging to get the pillow back into it after washing, which you must due to the chemical smell. A firmer, washable pillow with a durable fabric would be more appealing to me. Also, I do not believe this pillow is worth $55. I would not pay for this. I've had regular body pillows that cost less and work just as well.",1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",Easy to put together and very versatile. The only drawback I found is that the belt buckles were recalled as soon as I received the new seat.Ordered the new buckles and I'm ready to replace them as solos as they arrive.,4
"Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I loved how soft this diaper was out of the packaging. It remained soft during my several prep washes(to remove natural oils in the fabric). After my final prep wash, I found several holes forming along the seams. I never used the diaper, I just returned it as defective. The holes formed after only 6 washes and I couldn't see it holding up to numerous washes during the products intended use. I can only guess that I got a diaper sewn from a bad batch of fabric, I can't imagine these holes being the norm for this company.  I considered replacing the diaper, but would be disappointed if another prep routine was wasted on a diaper that may have the same problem.",1
Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket,"This was a Christmas gift for our daughter.  The purchaser selected the wrapped option, so when I got it, I looked at the invoice, saw that it said ""Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket"" and thought, great!  Come Christmas, our daughter opened it and imagine my surprise when she pulled out an all-black toddler comforter!  The company ran out and replaced it with what it deemed to be a ""suitable replacement"".  Nope!  It wasn't suitable for our teary-eyed daughter.  After 1 phone call, they shipped (overnight) a blanket.  I have no idea where they got it; it had been showing ""unavailable"" for a while.  Anyhow, the blanket is her favorite!  She takes it everywhere.  I've washed it many times due to this and the colors are still vibrant.  Well worth the wait and the customer service was outstanding.  Love it!",5
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety 8 Brackets,"This product is the absolute best solution I have found for securing our furniture so our toddler doesn't topple it. Here is why:- Durability, design: this product was built tough, easily customizes to whatever application you are putting it on (with brackets that can go vertically or horizontally and two sets of screws, long and short), and resists even the most forceful pull I put on a piece of furniture once installed.- Best price: this product was the most economical, costing us less per piece of furniture we secured.- Ease of use: it was incredibly easy to install. Simply mark where the stud is in the wall, and mark where that would be lined up on your furniture, move the furniture out from the wall, install the bracket either horizontally or vertically on both the wall and the furniture, start threading the zip tie, move the furniture back, and complete pulling the zip tie through so the wall and furniture are connected.The only extra consideration you may need to make is that you may need other sizes of screws in case the small screws are still too long for installing the brackets on a shelf or something with less depth.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","I really love this its versitile and had I breastfed I probably would have used it more. My boyfriend uses it more often than I do because it keeps his arm from going to sleep while holding the baby. Furthermore it makes a good sleeping pillow for adults, so technically it will never be grown out of. :)",4
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,My 1-month-old loves this mat. She likes to lay and watch the lights and listen to the music. It's also great for tummy time.,5
The First Years Disney Pooh Deluxe Sunshade,"This shade is definitely cute.  Amazon mailed it right away.  When we put it up on the window, it was pulled down a bit to far and it ripped from the top after only being up a couple of days.  I wound it up a bit higher so it couldn't rip further.  So that worked,  unfortunately after only about 2 month's worth of use, the bottom suction cup keeps popping off the window.It's no great big, hairy deal, but it would be nice if it stayed in one piece and stayed attached to the window.I choose this shade because of the poor reviews so many other shades have received.So, I guess it's still one of the better ones.--- oh, and you have to be sure not to roll down that window!  We haven't made that mistake yet, but you do have to be mindful of it.mk",4
Cocalo Daniella Six Piece Crib Set,"Absolutely love this bedding set. My favorite part is that it is not so girly and babyish that her whole room will need to be changed within a year. The set is so elegant, everyone compliments the bedding. The quality so far seems good, though I have only washed it once on delicate cycle. It has delicate material so I would suggest always using a delicate cycle in the washer. I would definitely buy this set over again.",5
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","We purchased this product because of our very active 4 year old that would get into everything...so far, we are very satisfied with the product, ease of installation...we would recommend it!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",It has two remove able tops just as shown in the picture good grip on any chairI am very satisfied I am regretting for buying the expensive baby high chair,5
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles","We got this seat as a spare booster for my husbands car and we love it. It is only used about 2-3 times a month, but my son says he likes it just as much as the one he rides in every day in my van.",5
"Dream On Me Elora Collection Toddler Bed, Cherry","this is a beautiful bed , my daughter loves it and it fits well with the decor in the room very durable design I can sit on it while putting my daughter to sleep and the bed doesn't even Creek.",5
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White","This is an excellent quality mattress and after 2 years it is still in perfect condition.  I have owned less expensive mattresses and after time, they either lost their shape or become too soft and almost flimsy.  I love that there is a very firm (but still comfortable) side for infants and you can later flip it to the toddler side.  We will be purchasing a second Colgate Classica III Foam Mattress in a few weeks for our new baby. I would absolutely recommend this mattress!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",This definitly makes my children washing there hands a much easier task.  I think it makes them feel like they have a little more control.,5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","Producto de calidad, es excelente y el uso ha permitido validar la durabilidad del mismo. 100 % recomendable. es lo m&aacute;ximo",5
"Sesame Street Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 40-Count","My son is potty-training and these are a lifesaver at public restrooms!!  They fold small enough to fit in my purse.  They stick to the seat really well, so I feel better about using any potty.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We bought one of these gates at a garage sale before our baby was due a couple of years ago. I didn't know anything about it and didn't even really know what we'd use it for. We LOVE this gate!!! So much that we just bought another one new. The vertical bars are great to keep kids (or dogs) from climbing over it. The step peddle is way too hard to push down for my son to manage (he's 28 months old) even if he tries - which he really doesn't. :) I frequently have hands full so the ease of opening without hands is hugely useful and appreciated. It's also easy to control and can be opened and closed very quietly if you have someone napping nearby. The only suggestion I'd make is to clean under it regularly if you have lots of animals and/or dirt in the house. I know that sounds funny but we have one in a doorway and when we shut the door it will push the foot pedal and move the gate a smidge each time. We also have a houseful of animals and dirt and I didn't think to take the gate out to clean under it regularly so the dirt from the motion of the gate wore away at the finish on the hardwood floor underneath. Not the gate's fault! Love these gates!,5
Cars Airplanes Construction Trucks Wall Sticker Decal for Baby Nursery Kids Room,I bought these to give a different look to my boys room and it worked perfectly! And when you have to take them off they don't lift up the paint.,5
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","I guess if I had read the description a bit more carefully I should have realized that the spout is actually not a true straw, but rather a hard straw-shaped spout that your child will suck from. The ""straw"" part of the cup is just the straw inside that draws up the liquid. If you already noticed this, then you are a step ahead of me. That said, I don't mind that much that it is not what I think of as a true straw cup (with a silicone straw on top).Overall, it performs fine and my 2-year-old daughter has had no problems at all drinking from it. The valve seems to be adequate to prevent spills, and it doesn't seem difficult at all for her to suck from, though she has been drinking from straw cups since about age 1, when she switched from bottle to cup, bypassing the sippy spouts.My main complaint about this cup would be the way the two-piece top is designed. The description did not mention -- and it is impossible to tell from the photo -- that there is a solid-colored top that screws on the cup (the piece with the spout), and then a clear plastic piece that snaps over it. The lid is attached to the clear plastic piece and flips down to cover the spout. My only guess about WHY this two-piece design is necessary is so that you could, I suppose, remove the clear piece entirely if you did not want or need a lid. Otherwise I'm a little bit puzzled as to the purpose. *shrugs*However, the problem is that if you do want this piece on, then liquid becomes trapped in between the clear piece and the main piece with the spout since they fit together tightly, and you'll have to pry them apart before washing, or else you'll have icky stuff festering between the two pieces. And who needs that? I curse this thing each time I have to wash it because they are hard to pry apart, and even takes a little elbow grease to snap them back together. Meh.",3
"NoJo Night Light, Butterfly",The flower is to heavy to hanged on the wall plug. So you can't really use it I use it without the flower,1
Infantino Stick and Play Highchair Toy,Adorable toy but pretty much worthless because it constantly falls over. Flower is top heavy. Ordered a few more sassy toys and they stick much better. Waste of money....ugh,1
Evenflo Comfort Select Dual Auto-Cycling Breast Pump,"I only use it twice a day at work and it has never given me problems. Suction is good, not great. You can plug it in to a wall or use batteries, this good for on the go use. Fits with my Dr. Brown bottles.The only con I have is it's really loud.Other than that its a great pump I use everyday.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack 10 oz No-Spill Cup with Flexi Straw, Colors May Vary",Let me first start by saying these are the only sippy cups i have been able to get my daughter to drink out of so i will keep buying. My problem with them are they often explode in hot cars when left there. When i say explode i mean red juice covered my cream colored seats and ceiling of my new honda crv. We went to disney and walked to the tram. Realized we forgot my daughters cup in the car we walked back to get it. When we opened the car door we saw the cup was shooting the red liquid everywhere. And i mean EVERYWHERE. We have a new water only rule in the car with these cups. Had one explode in my face on an airplane too. On my flight i didn't know what was happening for a couple of seconds. I knew liquid was hitting me but i didn't know why or where it was coming from. So my delayed confused response meant i got to spend my entire flight sticky covered in juice. I just need to remember to unscrew the top but these were unfortunate ways to learn this. Also if you forget you have unscrewed the top this causes accidents too. If their on my porch or even in my living room and it becomes warm at all liquid starts to come up and will soak whatever its sitting on. So forget about ever throwing one in a bag. I bring a thermos with me and an empty cup because i've soaked a couple of bags. My daughter also bites the soft mouth part and once it gets a hole you can't drink liquid out of it. I probably buy one a week. Now that i'm writing this review i'm thinking i'm an idiot for letting this fruit juice explosion go on any further and will try to find a new cup.,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I got this to go in the diaper bag, and it's a good size and well made like the large bag I use at home. My only complaint is that there isn't a strap or loop or anything so I can open it, hang it up, and toss stuff in while changing baby. It's easy enough to sew one on myself, but I wish I didn't have to.",4
"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Daisy Doodle",I like it. It is comfort & fit of a shirt . The color is so beautiful. My baby don't cry when she is setting,5
"Britax Advocate 70 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx",My daughter is 3 and has been in this seat for awhile.  It is very sturdy and appears to offer a high level of protection.  Also has a place for a cup holder to snap on that is very convenient.,5
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","I don't regret buying this stroller. It is easy to push, and goes through anything, including the gravel roads we live on. It's not hard for me to unfold it one handed, and it's lightweight. I would purchase it again.",5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","I needed a bib that would catch crumbs that were getting all over my baby's lap when she ate bread. This bib was perfect, and I love being able to wash it so easily. Unfortunately however, my 9 month old figured out how to pull it off within a week. She just pulls the bib until the plastic piece comes out. Such a bummer, as it pretty much renders it useless if I can't keep it on her.",4
Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack,After only a week the door latch was ripped off the wings are to weak they broke right off. It was easy to install but I wouldn't buy another one.,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"After much research, I had it narrowed down between this and the Diaper Genie.  I got this one and I LOVE it!  My son is now 8 1/2 mo. and we keep this in our family room.  My husband thinks every baby product is a crock, but he even commented about how great this diaper system is.  This is on my short list of baby items I couldn't live without!",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!",4
Stroller Net Tote Bag,"I got this item, because I saw that another buyer had bought it for her family trip to Walt Disney World and it worked great!  I figured that you couldn't go wrong for a dollar right?!  Well, I wish that I would have though again.  The bag itself seems good and that it SHOULD hold up.  On the other hand, the straps that hold in onto the stroller are not long enough at all!  they reach JUST far enough to go thru the buckle and back thru on our umbrella stroller.  I have tugged on it, and most times it doesn't come free, but sometimes it comes loose.  I think that I am going to have to make my own adjustments to it.  Add buttons, or velcro so that it has extra support.  On the picture it looks like it would work great if you have a stroller that the handles are connected...mine are not.  This doesn't allow me to slide the straps closer together.  Just think of this when you buy as to what kind of handles you have.  It looks kinda cheap in quality, so I don't think that I am going to put in anything other than diapers and light items in it.",3
Sesame Street Elmo Aviator 4-Piece Toddler Bedding Set,"I bought it from a different vendor and in store, but its the same bed set. WE LOVE IT! My son absolutely LOVES it and I have washed it multiple times and not had any problems!",5
Summer Infant 2-in-1 Cushy Cart Cover and Seat Positioner,"I just love this. I had an old, hand me down cart/highchair cover so I bought this new one. It fits literally every cart I've tried from Kroger to Target to Walmart or any other store. I love the cushion and so does my son. He relaxes right into it and I have little toys clipped onto the provided loops and he just snuggles in and plays while mama shops. The cell phone holder is great too. I actually at one point put Bubble Guppies on YouTube and tucked it in and he was smiling and excited. We have used this at multiple restaurants as well for high chairs(without the cushion of course) and it makes the high chairs more comfy for him too. I would recommend this to any mom!",5
"Kids Line Hamper, Mosaic Transport","This is cute and looks nice in the nursery. Definitely worth the money if getting the rest of the mosaic set. Well made, too.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,"I bought this stroller at BabiesRUs - it was one of two brnads/models they had for sale. (The Amazon price is about $10 less than I paid.) I've used this stroller many times and find it very easy to unfold/fold, the storage basket is ample, and the parent tray is convenient. I have no complaints at all with it. In fact, I had some paralysis in my hands as a result of my pregnancy, and I bought this stroller when I still couldn't move all of my fingers and my hands were very weak, and I could still fold it with one hand. It's very easy to use. I see that another reviewer had trouble with hers/his tipping over. I've never felt this stroller is unstable. I've used it with a Graco car seat and haven't had any trouble with its stability at all.",5
TUPPERWARE Shape O Ball Toy,This toy is for my greatgrandson and everyone of my kids has had one.  It's a great learning toy and you sell it forless than Tupperware,5
5pk Velcro Closure Bib Cutie Pie Born to Be Wild Motorcycle (White),Bibs are cute but last one is blank.  Kinda of a deception in my eyes.  Overall they are cute and ok.,4
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"I have had my eye on these tiles since I was 6 months pregnant with my third and I'm so glad my son is old enough to roll around and play on them! I love the modern colors and design - much better than the bright primary color mats I used with my older kids.  They clean up nicely and are easy to put together. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any issue with paint peeling off the animals.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,I didn't want my daughter to have to pack up every time my Grandon came over and this pack and play with the firm mattress added was perfect. Easy up and down and to travel with.,5
"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack","When I started making baby food, I thought I would appreciate the small serving size.  Unfortunately, one ounce is just too small for anything really.  They quickly ended up at the bottom of the baby food container options.",2
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I bought this organizer since I will use the pack and play in our living room for changes. I have the Graco basic pack n play and it does not have an attachment for diapers and supplies. This fit perfectly and holds everything I need.,5
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,My grand-daughter loved the duck and bath time was enjoyable but it doesn't squeak/quack like it says it does.  It is great to put in the tub and easy to empty the water and clean out.,3
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I am crazy about this cover.  It has double gussets and we never have leaks.  Before switching to cloth, we had blow outs all of the time.  We never have problems now.  This is my favorite cover.  Thirsties are economical, durable, and beautiful.  They wash up perfect and are dry in no time.  This is my go to cover and the color is perfect for a boy or girl.  I will say they seem to run small.  It fits my lo perfect now, but she is only 12 lbs.  It may fit up to 18 lbs but I think it will be tight.  That is just my opinion.",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I was just in a major fwy car accident. Hit at 60mph and spun through three lanes of traffic with my kids (ages 1,2,&3) three across in this car seat. The kids did not move an inch and the car seats withheld the impact to a degree I never thought possible. My kids came out with no injuries aside from a tiny (1 inch) skin irritation from the strap on my only forward facing child on the side of impact.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This product worked while I used it.  It just took over our whole bed!  I was so big I didn't want anything because I was always uncomfortable,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I thought this was a good alternative to the teethers that have the liquid in that you freeze, however, because of the appearance of this teether my baby thought it was a pacifier and gagged on it several times causing spitting up. It is a bit large, I think it would be better made in a smaller size.",3
"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor",Just recieved this in the mail today and I am So excited to start carring it!! Plenty of room and seperate compartments for anything you can think of. I also ordered the JJ Cole 2 bottle cooler with it and its also great. Definately reccomend!,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",A great liner for cloth diapering. No holes etc for having washed & dried it even though you're not supposed to dry PUL. Keeps the stink contained & fits a regular sized trash can.,5
"green sprouts 6 Ounce Oxo-Biodegradable Milk Storage Bags, Clear, 25-Count","I am happy about the quality of these bags...haven't had any issues with them at all.  And the fact they are green bags bakes them even better, especially for the price!",5
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I was very disappointed to receive a fake skip hop bag.  The picture and name clearly made it seem like I was buying an authentic product.  I have purchased many different skip hop items form Amazon, but this is the first time I have received a fake.  No use returning the item as the cost isn't worth it.  I think Amazon should refund my money for allowing this to have occurred.",1
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Chicco Single Strollers,This adapter makes it so easy to take the Chicco car seat and attach it directly to the stroller.  It seems very safe and sturdy.,5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,as soon as we got it my daughter doesn't want to use the potty anymore. great seat and it fits perfectly,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count",I would give this product 5 stars for touch and feel. Very soft. Easy to wear and wash. However they are awful at containing any amount of leak. I go through all 6 pads before morning is over. And forget about them working over night. The smallest amount of milk soaks right through to my bra and shirt. I have gone back to disposable pads,1
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,Finally a snack cup that doesn't spill. I highly recommend this product. The only time my son's cereal still falls on the floor is when he grabs too much out and they fly out of his hand as it passes the cloth.,5
Ellie Reversible Bumper by Cocalo,it was a little pinker than i expected from the original photo but it is very cute. love the fact it is reversible too. Sheet really completed the look.,4
Ginsey Dora Folding Travel Potty Seat,"I thought it was wonderful when I first bought it for my 2 year old, when we were first potty training. It was perfect for those in store potty runs!  However after about a month of using it, as my daughter became more comfortable using the toilet, she started trying to wipe herself etc. The movement and weight of her on the toilet seat caused the weak plastic to flex, pinching her bum, then sending her and the toilet seat crashing into the toilet. My potty trained two year old, is now refusing to sit on ANY toilet seat, because it &#34;Hurts&#34;. If I can coax her into going, it's a screaming match, and I have to hold her over the toilet seat (While I'm 5 months pregnant!) Waste of money.",1
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","We have been using this for over 2 years and are very happy with it.  I like the noise volume indicator lights, which have more lights lit up when she's crying louder so I can see if I better hurry up and get out of the shower in the morning.  (Our vent fan is loud so I can't hear it well)  The battery life is still good, at least 3 hours unplugged with checking the screen frequently.  It's more helpful for us now to be able to see what she's doing as a toddler than as a newborn.  Newborns don't try to climb out of cribs when mad.  We used a picture hanger nailed into the wall above her crib to mount the camera, so 90% of the mattress is visible.  When she was around 5 months old, she started rolling over at night and was MAD about being on her tummy.  It was nice to be able to see, yes I need to go turn her over vs I'm just fussing cause I feel like fussingIt's also compact enough we take it on all of our trips (It's been to USVI and mexico, plush all over MN and WI).  Now saying &#34;night night&#34; to the camera is part of her going to bed routine.",5
"Philips AVENT ISIS iQ Uno Electric Breast Pump, White","This is a great product for the money! I had no problems with it, and I used it for a solid six weeks since my newborn wouldn't nurse. I found it easy to use and clean. No problems.",5
Fisher Price Precious Planet Deluxe Auto Mirror with Music,I bought the Fisher Price Precious Planet Deluxe Auto Mirror with Music so my daughter would stop crying being alone in the back seat not able to see me. I would have to reach back and touch her hands before she would calm down or pull the car over on a number of occasions.  My oldest had a similar item in 2000. She loved it and stayed quiet. No such luck with the little one. I guess she does enjoy the music at times but it does not do much else to quiet her down. She is 9 months and ignores it most days. Maybe as she grows older she will enjoy seeing herself in the mirror. I think it would be nicer if it had lights that light up randomly on each animal,2

Mamas &amp; Papas Sola Stroller - Plum Petal,"We bought the sola in plum petal before our cruise trip and now have been using it for three weeks, it's really the best stroller among all the strollers we have owned and tried. I read some reviews before the purchase saying the wheels came off and front wheels appeared to be stuck, we have not had those issues. The wheels coming off seem to be an old version sola and the manufacturer has fixed it from the reviews I read on both U.S. and UK forums. Regarding the front wheels getting stuck - I think it was likely due to the owners didn't raise the brakes all the way up, we didn't know this in the beginning and felt the front wheels were not moving smoothly, but once I read the manual thoroughly and lifted the brakes all the way up, the ""stuck"" feeling of the front wheels was gone completely. We love the stroller so much and it well worths the money.Pros:-Very stylish beautiful stroller (better looking than uppababy, I was hesitating between mamas and papas sola and uppababy cruz before the purchase and couldn't be happier when I saw both strollers in person after the purchase)-Parent facing.-Smooth ride. I love the big rear wheels! I can push the stroller with one hand.-Everything is so easy and smooth - assembly, switch the facing direction of the seat, adjust the footstep, adjust the harness, adjust the recline position, put on and remove the holding bar, adjust the push bar, brake on and off......-Appropriate padded seat - not too bulky, not filmy, the fabric is soft and high quality, my 6 months old baby girl seems really enjoying sitting and sleeping in the stroller.-Seat is higher than some other stroller - the height makes it comfortable for me to feed the baby when I sit on a chair. The other two strollers we owned have the normal height seat, every time I have to bend down to feed the baby, causing my arm and back pain after a while. Our daughter is still too young to use the high chair in restaurant, now with sola, we just push the stroller closer to the table, play with and feed her, so convenient, worked well each meal we had on the cruise ship! The higher seat also gives a good clearance to the basket underneath so we can put a lot of stuff there.-Stylish and big canopy - some reviewers say the canopy is not big enough, for us, the size is appropriate, and our sola didn't have the net/see through part in the middle of the canopy that another version has, which was complained by parents that caused babies exposed to sunshine & got redness on their skin. Our sola has the peek poo window on the canopy.-Very easy fold and open. We have a mini van, so the size of the stroller after folding is not a problem for us. It is not an umbrella stroller and not compact after folding, it could be a con for parents with small cars but not for us. We actually like it that the fold and unfold is so simple.For us, the sola doesn't have a con although the not too compact size after folding could be a con for some parents. But there is no perfect stroller, the sola is by far the best stroller from the functionality / feature perspective according to our opinion.",5

Lambs &amp; Ivy Raspberry Swirl Warm and Cozy Blanket,"I bought this for my two year old as we are switching from baby to toddler. Her room was already decorated in this pattern as was her crib bedding. I didn't want to spend the money to change everything around just yet, but we needed a bigger blanket for her toddler bed. We really like the design and it's very soft and my daughter loves it. My only complaint is that it is shorter than I wanted. About the same size as the crib comforter (maybe a tiny bit longer). I was trying to save money on buying the toddler bed comforter that matches and getting this instead. If you are thinking about doing the same, spend the extra to get the comforter as this isn't long enough. Other than that, it was a good buy.",4
"Taggies Classic Take A Long Plush, Bouquet","The taggie is cute, the only thing I didn't like was the color. I purchased it for a boy and it definitely looks more pink than blue....deceiving in the picture.",4
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","The bamboo swaddling blankets are even softer than the regular Aden and Anais swaddling blankets (which I still love). They get softer with each wash. Because they are super stretchy, it makes swaddling baby that much easier, and they are the perfect weight of fabric for baby to stay comfortable all night. We used these every night until our son was about 3 months old and began to break his arms out of the swaddling. These are now my go-to gift for new parents!",5
Infantino Right Angle Tummy Triangle,"This is for sure a cool idea. My (now) 2 year old son hated tummy time, and maybe he would have liked it a little more if he had been propped up with the tummy triangle. However - my daughter has never minded tummy time and seems to be too old for the toy, even though she's just barely at the higher end of the suggested age range. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it would help, but I'm not sure it is necessary. Essentially, the same thing could be created for much less expensive with a couple toys and an infant support pillow - all of which could be used elsewhere as well. The toy wasn't easy to put together. While it's obvious what has to be done (I never even looked at the instructions!) it did take a lot of muscle to get the red feet snapped into the plastic so the play bar could be held. One thing that Infantino really got right is the mirror. My baby absolutely loves mirrors and really enjoyed looking at herself in it. It would be nice if the bee could be grabbed and pulled. She was reaching for it, and obviously wanted to play, but it was always just out of reach.Overall, I think there's something to be said for the convenience of the Right Angle Tummy Triangle. It's not a must-have baby product, but it's definitely a nice thing to own if you've got the disposable income or generous friends/family.I have received the Right Angle Tummy Triangle from Infantino to facilitate my review.",3
"Zoli Baby Bot XL Straw Sippy Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack, Green/Pink","Ughhh..... these cups. I love the design. I love the weighted straw which is perfect for new learners. I absolutely HATE how these leak!! They leak from the sides. They leak from the straw. And its not just a tiny bit of water... we're talking a puddle. It is so incredibly frustrating. I tried everything to stop this from happening from wiping down the lid and the rim of the cup to adjusting how tightly the lid was screwed on-- nothing. I also tried pulling the straw as i heard that would release some pressure (???) and i broke it. I bought another thinking that maybe washing it in the dishwasher had something to do with it and it happened again. I found a much better cup and it's the Foogo by Thermos. That cup is incredible. That being said, i may (sigh) still use the Zoli for my next kid in the beginning (the very, very beginning) to learn how to drink from a straw because the weighted straw is a genius idea but will switch to something better like the Foogo i mentioned above as soon as possible.",2
Jeep Baby View Mirror,"In the product discription it says that the mirror is 10x9x2 inches. The mirror I received is 2x4 inches.  I was hoping for a nice big mirror to put facing my rear facing child so I can see him in my rearview mirror.  This mirror is made to attach to the windshield or somehow clip onto my rearview, although I see no way to attach the mirror the the clip.  I'm very sad that the discription outright lies about the size of the mirror!Update:  I went to the makers website and their own page discribed the mirror as 5x7, still much bigger than the 2x4 mirror that I received, so I contacted the company directly and they are sending me a 5x7 mirror with no extra cost!  The customer service was great! Kind person, timely response and like I said, they are sending me the one I thought I was ordering in the first place.  Although, there is still no way to attach the mirror to the visor clip.",3
Who's Shoes Kids ID Kit (BLUE),"I was searching everywhere for a safety tag that could not be wiped/pulled/ripped off.  My son is a nonverbal 7-year-0ld diagnosed with autism & would have no way to give crucial ID information if he were to get lost (my biggest fear).I absolutely LOVE this product. I attach it to his sneaker & it remains secure & noninvasive to my son.  I have tried virtually everything, including expensive ID bracelets/necklaces, only to have him rip them off.I always buy extra to share them with other parents who have very young or special needs children. These come in both pink & blue & are worth every penny!!! I just wish these were sold in packs of 4 or 5, instead of just 2.",5

"Lorex LW2450 LIVE Video Home. Pet, and Baby Monitor with Pan/Tilt Wireless Camera (White)","I'm not sure why they keep saying these are baby monitors when the box clearly says HOME monitor on it. That being said, this is a great product for home security. I have a previous version (or smaller one) of this that I had reviewed before, using it also as a home security camera. This new set is much better and has more features, such as the pan & tilt camera that allows a much greater viewing area. This also has a nice two way talk feature which is so handy if you live in a big house. It also features night viewing so if you use it for outdoor security or inside your house at night, it still ""sees"" everything, regardless of lighting. It has sound activated recording too which I can imagine being useful in just about every circumstance! One little perk I like is that it also monitors temperatures in the room. My house, being big and drafty (and frightfully cold this month) needs better temperature monitoring than what I have been doing previously. This camera set really helps me keep things balanced in here.This is nice also in that you can view remotely, what is going on in (or out) of your house (depending where you have the camera). I do travel a lot in the warmer months, and it will be awesome to keep an eye on my house when I am away. It makes me feel SO much better to have that luxury!It shows on the box that you can also expand the system with buying an outdoor camera, and I am definitely going to do that, so I can have that looking around my yard, and then this one covering the inside. I think these security systems are fantastic, and since I live in a big city where crime is unfortunately rampant, you can't go wrong buying cameras like these to safely and inconspicuously monitor your home.I very highly recommend this set for that use, or even as Amazon tries to sell it for - as a baby monitor (though incredibly elaborate for that).It's a premium quality camera/monitor system that will serve you very well and give you priceless peace of mind.",5

"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This is fabulous! Before, I would wake up in the middle of the night to feed the baby and I was super engorged and/or leaking through breast pads. I would have to feed my little one, wait for her to fall asleep so I could put her down, then pump before going back to bed. Now, I can pump and feed her at the same time, which allows me to go back to sleep much quicker!As for the product itself, it is extremely well made, the fabric is amazing, it fits great and is VERY adjustable. I have not washed it yet, but I can tell from the quality of the fabric that it will hold up very well for a LONG time. I definitely recommend this.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,I decided to try the magic sleep suit after the reviews I've read fr amazon.com. My 4.5 month old daughter have started fighting with the swaddle me and has not been getting good sleep since. Since we started using the sleep suit she has been sleeping good. Not more than when she was not fighting with her swaddle but same! I use it sometimes at her nap time and at night. I highly recommend this. I will even buy another one once she out grows this one. I would like to note however that the only reason I am giving it four stars is that the item i received had its zipper broken after one week of use. I emailed the seller (sleepsuit) and they replaced my item promptly.,4
Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer,This item is inappropriate for any child that can't lift their own head. I purchased it for my 1 month old and she slouched down in the seat so her chin was touching her chest. After readjusting her several times I realized she couldn't sit in the seat unless I propped something underneath it which isn't very safe. The toys are also pretty useless from what I can see. They don't come attached and are too close to her face. Definitely spend the few extra dollars on a better chair if possible.,1
"Luvable Friends 4-pack Water Resistant Bibs with Pocket, Blue","I really like this brand, the bibs are really cute. Nice quality, but the soft side of the Velcro is made of cheap material. It doesn't stick to the rough side, so my baby can very easily pull the bibs off during meal time. I'm going to have to attach a snap on them so he can't get them off. Other then that I'm very happy with my purchase.",4

Kidz Delight Smithsonian Kids Space Tablet,"First, the machine has three modes: Discovery, Exploration, and Quiz.  When you use Discovery mode, the tablet tells you the name of that picture along with one of many bizarre sounds.  When you use the Exploration mode, it gives you some brief statements for each item.  The Quiz mode is a quiz. I didn't do much with the Quiz mode because I think the Exploration mode is too disappointing to care what it quizzes on.I understand that this toy couldn't contain all the information about the planets but some very basic information I would expect to be there is lacking. I was looking for more of the standard information by which most of us identify the planets:  Mercury, smallest, closest, fastest.  Mars, Red Planet.  Saturn, rings.  Uranus, outermost planet. Just a few words inserted into the sentences they use would have helped (see my example number 2 below).  Also, if you look closely at the picture of the tablet, you will note also that the position of the planets in the solar system is very poorly depicted and incomprehensible to a young child. A picture CAN be worth 1000 words, but not this one...Some buttons have one statement for that picture, some have two.  Here are some examples.1.The stars button says only that ""Stars are very far from the Earth and are very hot.""  Why didn't they mention that stars are made of gases, example: ""...are very hot because they are made of gases"".2. ""Mercury looks like the moon because it has craters and basins."" I would have used two lines, such as: ""Mercury, the smallest planet, looks like the moon because it has craters and basins.""  ""Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, has the fastest orbit.3. Saturn's two lines don't mention its rings.4. Mars says only ""Mars has similar seasons to the Earth.""  Now, how hard would it have been to at least insert after ""Mars"" the phrase ""the red planet""?  This is something a child could relate to when looking at the night sky.5. The statement that Jupiter is the largest planet and has no solid surface"" should have added an explanatory phrase, such as 'because it is made of gases'.Here is a transcript of what is on the tablet under the Exploration mode:Sun is a star at the center of the solar system.Our system of planets is called the solar system.Mercury looks like the moon because it has craters and basins.Venus is the hottest planet and the closest planet to the Earth.The Earth is the biggest of all the rocky planets.The Earth is the only planet where life has been found.The moon is a satellite of the Earth.  It orbits around it.Mars has similar seasons to the Earth.On the 6th of August 2012 the robotic vehicle Curiosity landed on Mars to see if it once had the right conditions for life.Jupiter is the largest planet and has no solid surface.In many ways Saturn is similar to Jupiter but smaller.  (I DON'T THINK THIS STATEMENT IS USEFUL TO SMALL CHILDREN AT ALL.)Saturn is the second largest planet.Neptune has six thin, dark rings which circle the planet.Uranus has 21 moons.Pluto is the most famous member of a group of icy worlds on the outer edge of the solar system.Space shuttles were used to transport people and other things into space.The Space Shuttle Discovery launched the Hubble Space TelescopeThe longest-serving space shuttle Discovery flew 39 times from 1984 through 2011.In 1961 the Russian Yuri Gagarin became the first man to trave  into space.In 1969 the American Neal Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon.In an observatory, astronomers use giant telescopes to observe distant galaxies.Space telescopes orbit the Earth and send  astronomers images of space that can't be seen in telescopes on the Earth's surface.Meteorites are rocks from space that strike the Earth.Shooting stars are fast moving pieces of dust and rock that catch on fire when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.Stars are very far from the Earth and are very hot.A constellation is a group of stars forming a shape in the sky.",2

Naturepedic MPS2438 Organic Cotton Portacrib Mattress,"I'm not going to worry about every little thing with my baby, but seeing as baby is going to be spending up to 12-14 hours a day on a mattress--it better be baby safe.  When I research on-line about the most dangerous things for a baby, I found off-gasing from new products to be the most toxic and specifically off-gasing from mattresses.  I think this off-gasing, which can mess up baby's endocrine system and do other nasty things is a really big deal and I would encourage all parents to research what you can do to keep the main toxic products away from your baby.  Start with a non-toxic mattress like this one!",5

Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano,"Oh how my son adores this piano. It has a permanent place on his high chair and captures his attention the moment we put him in it.When we first used this he was ~3-4 months and he would press on the keys a little. Now, at 6 1/2 months, he slams this thing around and we've never had any issues. He loves the spinning part on top with the little balls - he is simply fascinated by the way the balls spin around. He knows how to (accidentally) switch from piano mode to counting mode with the little lever too. When in piano mode (or just normal play mode, as you have the option or flute, piano or xylophone) he slams the keys down and thinks he's really playing. It keeps him occupied for long periods of time which is great.We used ours for ~3 months before the batteries it came with (3 AA) died but we've stocked up on plenty of rechargeable batteries at this point.Overall, a great toy to keep your young baby occupied and stimulated.",5

"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","These bottles are the best at reducing air swallowed by the baby - unless you want to use those bottles with disposable liners. Seeing as I don't like to use anything ""disposable"" (as if we didn't create enough trash already!) these are the best choice.If your baby doesn't have huge problems with acid reflux, doesn't spit up a lot, and generally seems fine with feeding, and you'd like to reduce the parts to clean a little, you may also considerPlaytex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 6 Ounce. We use both, and both have survived 2 kids so far.*To clarify: Technically the VentAire bottles have the same number of parts. But since you can pre-build the bottles it seems like less hassle when you actually fill them. They also take a little less space. That being said - the child has to suck hard to suck air into the bottle and avoid swallowing air. If they instead open their mouth to let air in through the nipple the design is negated. Dr Brown's are still the best.",5
Deluxe Tandem Rain Cover - Fits 2 Canopy Tandem Strollers,"We bought this rain cover for our Baby Trend Deluxe Tandem stroller because we were going to Disneyworld and knew we would get rained on at some point during the trip. It didn't fit exactly right-had to pull it pretty hard to get it over the handle on the back and it ripped at the seam. It served its purpose though-it kept the stroller and the boys dry.It was also next to impossible to fold up into a small space again-I folded and squished it into a canvas bag that I strapped onto the back of the stroller. I have since kept it hanging there on the back of our stroller for days when we are caught out in unpredictable weather.The shield works great to keep high wind off the boys' faces, but in serious wind, it catches air from underneath and takes flight. The straps that supposedly secure it to the stroller do not fit the Baby Trend Deluxe that I have.Overall, we have gotten our money's worth from it, even though it doesn't fit perfectly.",3

Cool Gear Travel Potty,"This potty has been a lifesaver on many occasions during potty training!  Everything locks into place very well, so that it's sturdy enough for a child to sit on (not sure how much weight it will hold).  The only drawback for me is that I have difficulty unlocking the storage areas.  Maybe they lock into place a little *too* well!  But I generally leave the potty set up in the trunk of the van, and leave the storage area with the extra ziploc bags ajar (doesn't affect sturdiness) so that I can quickly get it ready.  I have ziploc bags in one storage area, and plastic grocery bags in the other so that I can put used ziplocs in a bag ... don't need to be seen walking around with a bag of pee.  :)",4

UPPAbaby Rumble Seat,"I have 2 girls almost exactly 2 years apart, and got this to add to my 2009 Vista when the younger was born.  I was skeptical about how much use I'd get out of it, and whether my older daughter would object to being in this seat, but I can say I am happy with the amount of use I've gotten out of the Rumble Seat in the last 18+ months.  It was less useful with the carseat adapter, but got to be really handy when younger sis could go in the regular toddler seat. So many options- sometimes the little one would be in the ergo and I'd use the Vista as a single, or we'd roll with it as a double. Once I got the hang of it, I could snap the rumble seat on and off in 30 seconds.Now, I have 2 walkers, and we don't use a stroller quite as much as we used to, but my 3 year old still likes to hop in the rumble seat and have a snack when she gets tired.  The girls prefer riding facing each other-- they don't seem to be bothered by the one having her feet in the other's face.  Sometimes they trade places for fun.  My older is super tall (38"") so took the sunshade off ages ago, and just use the seat without it. I don't miss it.Even with the second seat the stroller handles better than most full sized singles. Be careful that the foot rest is properly attached to the bars(it stays there even if the seat isn't on) - I got lazy and left the velcro undone and the basket ripped from the weight of the rumble seat occupant's feet.Would I do it all again?  There's a bunch of cool doubles out there now (like the city select) and so maybe my decision would be harder now.  Also, if you have 2 kiddos riding 100% of the time, a real double (like a side by side) might suit you better.  But given that I already have a Vista and could use a double now and then, the rumble seat definitely works.  Now I need to decide if I want to splurge for a piggyback too...",4
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],Since this is the only one that's not complete junk it gets a 4 and not a 3. I ordered a set of these at the end of july and my 7 month old already broke one. The other one is in the process and the plunger piece inside wont stay in. these are just cheaply made. These are however a life saver and without them would be a nightmare. I only wish i could find one in 8 oz as my little girl eats about 6 oz of food and when i take it to put more food in it she gets mad and screams till im back. If you need a feeder as i think everyone does this is your only option and works for a few months then it breaks. I have never put these in a dishwasher only washed them by hand. If anyone knows of a better feeder i would love some info. or one with 6 or 8 oz thats for food. NEVER NEVER NEVER LEAVE YOUR CHILD ALONE WITH THIS . These are dangerous and can choke your baby to death.,4
"Malden Sneak Peek Sonogram Juvenile Frame, White",I had bought this frame because I had  this for for my 1st grandchild.  I wanted a 2nd for there second child.  It was a great gift.,5
Evenflo Comfi Angled Bottle 9oz (3Pack),"I'm not very satisfied with these bottles.  For one, the rim of the bottle is more narrow than other bottles.  This means if you add your formula directly from the can to the bottle, the scoop doesn't exactly fit down into the bottle, allowing easy transfer of the formula.  You end up making a mess all over the bottle with spilled formula, not to mention, you are losing formula you should be using in the process!Also, the lids to these bottles are not a secure fit.  They will easily come right off, leaving quite a mess in your diaper bag.Save your money and buy another bottle set!",2
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet","I wanted this one to get us through the first 8 weeks.  The cuddle cove rocker is perfect for toting baby from room to room when you are trying to get stuff done.  And the changing table is great b/c you don't have to leave the room for those many changes that come in the first few months.  I really wish the storage was bigger on the side.  Other Pack 'N Plays had nicer storage, but I bought a little caddy that I keep next to it.  Still giving it 5 stars.  I'm sure it will work just as well when the baby gets bigger and uses it as a play yard type set up.",5
Angel Dear Pink Bunny Blankie,so soft and sweet - perfect for a baby gift.  this turned into one of my daughters favorite sleeping toys,5
Trend Lab Baseball Shelf with Peg Hooks,"The Trend Lab Daisy Shelf is very cute and sturdy. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have a rather large scratch on one of the flat panels. It is in a place that is not terribly noticeable, so we elected to keep it rather than replace it. The gingham daisies are a nice clear pink, BTW. In the photo, they look a little purple-y.",4
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",We used this for our baby in his first few months of life.  Worked like a charm to keep him asleep at night.  I would highly recommend swaddling for anyone considering it and this is a very easy way to accomplish that task.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Straw Bottle, Ladybug, 12 Ounce","As a mom, I don't have time to clean up so the sippy cups that like to spill everywhere are my worst enemy. This is no spill, the lid closes and opens easily which keeps me from worrying about the straw touching some nasty thing and my daughter doesn't have to bring it to me every time she wants a drink. It has a wrist strap that is easy to remove (if you get the safety harness backpack, you can attach the wrist strap to the front harness so your kid won't lose it), and it comes with an extra straw in the package. Good choice.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Product information was very accurate and unit works as described.  Unit is very sturdy.  I have used it to replace a wooden unit,5
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Marlowe",I bought this when my second daughter was born because she wouldn't sleep well in the bassinet that rocks because it would move every time she did.  She slept well in the bassinet feature as a newborn and we still use it when we travel and she is now turning one.  She is starting to get a little snug....  It was also nice because it is a little smaller than the normal Pack and Play so I was able to keep it set up in my bedroom.  The only problem I had was that it didn't fold up as nicely as our other pack n play but it is doable.  This is a great purchase for parents expecting a new baby.  It is a bassinet and travel system all in one!,4
Glass Table and Shelf Corner Cushions,"These corner cushions are an absolute waste. We put them on our coffee table one morning and by mid-morning, our 9 month old had managed to pull them all off. I tried sticking them back on but they flop off at the slightest touch. In fact, tonight, my daughter fell into the coffee table and knocked the ""corner protector"" off on her way down, catching her lip before she hit the floor. Ouch! We would have been better off not having the false security of these dumb things.",1
"Delta Children's Products Natural 4 in 1 Crib, Natural",My son and I put this together for my Granddaughter and the only issue I had was that when I rubbed my hand down part of the wood...I got a huge splinter!  I am just glad that it happened to me and not the baby!!  Other than that the crib is really nice and was very easy to assemble!!,4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",so much easier than holding two shields and bottles while pumping!  I own 2 of them now so I always have a clean one (I do drop milk on it when I remove the shields).,5
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, 10 Ounce - 2 Pack (Pink/Orange)",Son loves this cup! Finally we found one that he can't take the straw out of! And with really only one piece to take off and clean I think this was a great buy.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",Very good works at it claims I totally like it my daughter love the colors and it is safe for her,5
Eddie Bauer Classic Wood Swing,"My son is almost 15 weeks now.  He loves the swing and we use it on the highest speed since we start him in it.  The motor just failed on us.  I would not buy this swing again.  The straps are to hard to use and aren't removable for cleaning.  We don't use the straps.  It is bulky to take with you.  The tray is ok.  Nice looking but it needs to work.  Shoddy workmanship on the motor.The music stops if you hold the button in, just like the swing button.  If anyone knows how to get a hold of the manufactuer, please post it.Dave",1
Baby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic,"I just used this on my 5 month old son and the feet turned out great.  The hands turned out pretty nice too, even though he wanted to touch everything with his inked up hands.",4
"Gerber Washcloth Set (Light Cream, Dark Cream, Blue, Orange, Green), 10-Count","These are of nice quality. They are soft and even after washing them numerous times, they are still soft. Would recommend them to my friends.",5
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"This is a very basic little mobile. We have it clipped to the grab bar in the backseat of our car over the infant carseat. This is a great place for it because it gives my girl something to look at, while it doesn't interfere with her safety in the event of a collision. The mobile is so lightweight that if for some reason the clip came undone (which seems impossible), the entire thing falling on her would not cause any injury. When I drive the mobile gently bounces around and keeps her very happy. Another great way we use it is to unclip it from the car and then clip it onto the carseat bar when she needs a little bit of entertainment when out and about in the stroller or at a store.",5
"Clevamama ClevaFoam Baby Pillow, Cream",It soft and material appears to be excellent. We believe that our baby is happy with it. So we love itFive stars for Amazon as usual,5
"Sale: 80 Piece (2 Set) Non-toxic foam Wonder Blocks for Children w/ Carry Totes: Soft, Quality, Bright Safe &amp; Quiet",I had these foam blocks in my house from years ago and needed to order some for grandchildren. They love to build and when they decide to throw them nobody gets hurt.,5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss 4 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce","My daughter and nephew LOVE the cups! Easy to use, durable, and colorful! Have the item for a few months now, and no complaints",5
"Stars &amp; Stripes Green, Organic Muslin Swaddling Blankets 2 Pack","I bought the Green Swirls Bambino Land Organic Muslin Swaddling Blankets (gave a 5 star review) and ordered these because I loved my first purchase so much.However, the quality on these Stars & Stripes ones are terrible compared to the Green Swirls.  When I first took it out, it didn't even feel like muslin, more like linen, it was so stiff.  I should've returned it then and there, instead, I decided to give it a wash in hopes that it would soften up because I LOVE all of my other organic Bambino land products (crib sheets, burp cloths, swaddling  blankets).  I've washed them about 15-20 times now, and it's only beginning to feel somewhat softer, but it does not feel the same as the green swirls.  When I hold them side by side, the green swirls blankets looks like it has a higher thread count.  Shame on Bambino for cutting corners.",2
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"My 4 month old loves this, the music entertains him and he likes to lay on his back and swat at the toys.  I can see him using this as he grows.  It's well made and the music variety is great, a must have!!",5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Bedrail, White",it was a pain to put together.  all though it does work for what i needed it for.  but baby still not in big boy bed.,3
"Rumble Tuff Single Electric Breast Pump, Easy Express",comes with more than is shown however it includes everything listed in the description bar. it pumps easily an effectively in a very quick amount of time and has several different adjustment speeds. i am an at home mom so i usually breast feed but use the pump whenever i need my fiance to feed or to give my breast a break so the single pump works fine for myself.,4
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","Clear picture but range could be better, thus the missing star. I had to go around house to see where range ended which was a bummer.",4
Munchkin Sesame Street Fresh Food Feeder,"Seriously. My baby boy of 8 months will eat anything and put anything in his mouth, except for this. He loves fruits and we always watch him very carefully every millisecond he does so. It gets difficult so we bought this. Luckily I just bought one, because normally I just buy things in multiples to make it easier on me later.I'm sure it's a good product, and it's a good concept, but don't have high expectations.",3
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,I actually use this to keep the door open to the room where we keep the cat's litter box. Its a subtle product and keep guests from closing the door.,5
Fisher-Price bConnect Digital Soother,"My baby likes this soother, except it will turn off after 10 minutes which means if she isn't quite asleep yet she will start crying. The remote is nice to have except it only turns the soother on and off. It should be able to change the screen too. Music selection and brightness controls are nice to have. Overall, worth $90, but falls short of my expectations.",3
Bright Starts Snuggle Teether,"We have purchased the elephant version of the Snuggle teether as add-on gifts for at least three baby showers.  My grand-daughter (now 9 months old) loves hers. When she was younger, she liked to crinkle the tummy section.  Now she is more interested in gnawing on the feet.  This teether is soft enough for pre-teething babies to cuddle and lightweight enough for them to hang on to it by themselves.",5
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,I make my own baby food and this mash and serve bowl is a total lifesaver.  I think I need another one actually!  I use it to mash up avocados or bananas and it works really well and is so easy to use.,5
Especially for Baby Stroller Umbrella,I like that you can shade your baby from the sun from the sides. But the grip for the umbrella is very small and doesn't fit the Graco stroller well at all.,3
"Re-Play Divided Plates, Aqua, Green, Orange, 3-Count","We probably have 4 or 5 different brands of plates (Munchkin, Tupperware, Nuby) and these are by far the best!  They stack together nicely and have nice deep compartments for foods.  They wash up well in the dishwasher.  We will probably start getting rid of all our other plates and just keep these, wish we would have bought them first.",5
Munchkin Deluxe Drying Rack,"Love this rack.  I am using Dr. Brown bottles and this rack fits all the parts perfectly for 4 bottles.  Actually thinking about getting another Munchkin deluxe drying rack.  My baby is starting to drink more now.  I tried to fit 5 Dr. Brown bottles on this rack once, but it was too crowded with all of the bottle parts.  Took too long for all of the parts to dry.",5
Cloud b Polar Cuddle Bear Sleep Aid - Gently Shivers For Comforting Touch,We tried this little bear for a child that was having separation anxiety at night.He has been doing much better sleeping since he's had the Cloud B Polar Cuddle Bear.,5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These were exactly what I was looking for.  They held together great while we used them on our ""bucket"" car seat.  They kept the straps off of our daughters neck and gave her a little extra pillow to take a nap on.  We got lots of complements on how cute they are.  We'll use them for our next baby, as long as its a girl, otherwise I'll just order the blue ones!!!  They wash up great in the washing machine too...",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,"This is by far a 100% improvement over the original diaper genie.  No odor, easy to change, no twisting.  This thing is perfect.  We just bought a 2nd one for our newborn's room.  This is a must buy!",5
Versatile Play Pen - Large (16 pieces),"Works as intended. Provides ample space for a toddler. Easy to assemble. We combined it with a foam floor mattress, which works great. The connections work well when mounting them the first time. I think that they may  become looser over time if the playpen is assembled and disassembled a few times.",4
NoJo Little Bedding  Jungle Time 4 Piece Crib Set,"This set appears to be the cheaper version of the Jungle Babies set.NoJo Jungle Babies 6 Piece Crib Bedding SetThat one is 100% cotton and more than twice the price. The good news is that this one is still cute and you can mix and match with the Jungle Babies separate pieces (sheets, valance, lamp, etc) most of the pieces of that one match this one pretty well. The sheet that comes with this set is pretty thin and scratchy.",4
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Veloce Stroller, Mint Java","This stroller is very poorly made. The wheels are cheap and it's hard to fold. Save your money, not worth the buy!!!",1
Preemie / Bassinet Wedge,Our daughter was not comfortable at all with this. The nap nanny worked much better (until she was old enough to try and get out).  For infants (with breathing issues that require a thirty degree angle or for reflux- our daughter had both) go with the nap nanny instead. This was a waste of money.,1
"Bedtime Originals Champ Snoopy Musical Mobile, Blue",Very cute mobile that goes great with the matching crib set [...]. The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the plastic is rather cheap and somewhat flimsy. However it serves it purposes and like I said looks great.,4
SnugZee Baby Head Support Neck Stabilizer Car Seat Pillow - Prism,"My son's head will still fall forward when he falls asleep.  It is a nice cushion for his head side-to-side, though. I just think that there really is not a product out there that will prevent the baby's head from falling forward in car seat.  :)",3
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","My husband used to work for a company that ran a pregnancy magazine, and we received a few of these, in different sizes and materials (glass and plastic), free. I don't remember which we used first - I think it was a 4oz glass one - but it was brilliant, so we went out and bought lots more recently, when baby started eating 6oz in one feed.They are AWFUL. The vent retains that nasty old-formula smell, even when they've been rinsed, cleaned in a dishwasher, and sterilised. I've never known bottles leak like these do. They are constantly sticky because they leak so badly that formula goes everywhere. My husband used to be a weightlifter, and even his vice grip tightening the collars down doesn't stop leaks.And the lids never even stay on! I went out yesterday with these in my diaper bag, and the lids kept popping off with the slightest pressure applied to the sides (such as when my diaper bag brushed against my hip while I was walking) - it's ridiculous!We bought a set of 4oz Evenflo bottles, 3 for $5, and they're ten times better than these pieces of junk. Maybe the glass ones will be better, but the plastic are certainly a total waste of money.",1
"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","life saver for us!  our little one naps in it 3-4 times/day. When she wakes up, i turn on the music and mobile - keeps her entertained for at least 20 more minutes!",5
"Contigo Bpa-free Kids Autoseal Mugs 9 Oz, Green","My grandchildren love drinking out of these mugs/cups, and my daughter and I love it when they do. These mugs are easy for an older child to use -- starting at 3-4, I'd say -- and they don't spill! Well, if they were to hold the mug upside down while pushing in the button, it would. But if they drop it or throw it or leave it sitting somewhere and the cat knocks it over -- then it does not spill. I've even carried them in bags when they were full and they didn't spill. I've given them to other mothers and they love them too! This isn't just a travel mug; it's an all the time mug.As for the green one -- my grandsons fight over who gets the green ones!",5
"Kushies On The Go Snack Bag, Blue Square, Small","I was unsure what size I wanted to get because this was my first replacement towards disposable plastic zip-lock bags (yay!). I went with the largest size they had because the bigger the better, right? There was no harm in getting a size too big, but too small would have a problem fitting my sandwiches.When I got it, it was the right size for me. I'm a high school student who brings a simple lunch to school: a regular sized sandwich, a capri sun, and perhaps a bag of chips or dried fruit. Those three things all fit snugly into the Kushies and I was so satisfied.If you're contemplating your choice based on the reviews that say it barely holds anything, just get the largest size possible. It won't hurt you. After all, a little extra room doesn't hurt.By the way, the color is gorgeous and the material shows potential to endure the next four years of college. Definitely machine-washable and I recommend, if putting a sandwich in, you should saran wrap it first. That's what I do to keep it clean!",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,I am soo disappointed in this product! Especially for the cost of the unit and the refills. I've had the Diaper Dekor Plus for 3 months now and I hate it! It smells like deodorizer PLUS diaper! It's so gross. The only thing it has going for it is it's sleek look (fooled me). Don't waste your money.,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I wanted something simple so after looking around in the store my husband and I chose this for our baby registry.For the most part, it works great.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because filling the tube with the amount of water ""supposedly"" required isn't entirely accurate.  Sometimes we'd put the appropriate water and it wouldn't heat enough.  On the other hand, there are times we wait until the unit tells us the unit is warm and it's super HOT!  That is defitnely a warning--it doesn't just warm the bottle.  Sometimes it really HEATS it up.I just recently also started using the baby food jar warmer attachement and that works great.This product is compact so it won't take up a lot of room (something that was very important to me because I live in an apartment) and cleans very well.  The cord, however, is not long at all so you'll have to put it close to the outlet unless you can use an extension cord.  It's great for quick fixes though.  The bottle does not take long at all to heat whether large or small.A good product.  It is durable and I know will last me for other children I may have.",4
CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"This is a great product. While I poo, I can download the ipoo app and see what my poo is telling me about my health, then I can share the info on FB, twitter and upload best poos to instagram to let all my friends, family and followers know what is going on. I've already gotten 5,378 likes. Great wrap around product.",5
Lamaze Morgan the Monkey Play and Grow,too cute was looking for a carseat toy for my friends baby definately got a great toy......... ...... ....... ...,5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","bought the stroller because i have to go spend a few days in downtown atlanta with just the kids, and i don't really want to struggle with a cranky toddler just because i only have one stroller. had it delivered within two days (ordered sunday night, delivered by tuesday afternoon). unfortunately the package was missing a rear wheel hardware kit and a manual. the stroller itself is easy enough to assemble without the manual, but the missing hardware makes the stroller pretty much useless, as i can't stroll without the back wheels falling off the axle every so often.since it was already past 5pm i emailed the customer service via their website, and got a response early wed morning. the rep (Dave) promised me to overnight expedite the kit so I can receive it before I go. Unfortunately I leave in the morning and there is no way it can reach me before i go. I applaud the quick response and effort though.The stroller itself is great. it's heavier than standard plastic stroller since it's made of steel. when folded is pretty compact. I can put it sideways and fit with it a big suitcase, a carry on, 2 backpacks and a bunch of other shopping finds in my car trunk (chrysler aspen, back seat folded). with both kids on the stroller it's pretty easy to steer, although the heaviness makes it feel like i'm using a brand new shopping cart. i can ever steer easily while holding baby in my hand and my bigger kid sitting on the stroller. both kids are happy. yes, your bigger kid can't sit if the front seat is reclined. and yes, you can't get to the bottom storage if your kid is sitting on the bench, but i don't mind. no parent cup holder, yes that's a bummer. but i can always buy a separate attachment, i think. what i most like is it's compact and maneuverable (i can stroll in and out of tiny spaces easily).overall i haven't used the stroller for an extensive time, but at a glance i'm happy with the purchase. great customer service too.",4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I've been obsessed with making my own baby food AND buying premade baby food in pouches (You know for those times you just have to grab and go).  With my homemade baby food, it's usually not practical to put the cubes in a container and bring it with you.  I started researching reusable pouches for those weekend errand days where I can feed the baby food I've made.  These work perfectly!  I usually put a couple of cubes in the pouch a day before and leave it in the fridge.  The ziplock seal on top is really tight and even when i fold up the bottom and squeeze the last drops out, it doesn't open.  I've been recommending these to everyone!",5
Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode,"We had a high priced video monitor but returned it as it wasn't much useful. Got the Philips Avent audio monitor and it works flawlessly. The video monitor had to be couple of times a day while this one goes on for couple of days on a single charge! The audio is as good as the one on digital phone. Very crisp and DECT doesn't interfere with WiFi or other systems. The night light has a warm soft glow. The monitor connects flawlessly and very quickly. Haven't tested the range much but works pretty well a block or two down.Be careful If you bring the remote close to the base it gives out a screeching noise which might wake up the baby. While switching off the remote, it makes a light sound which can't be classified as annoying or irritating.Overall, the product is awesome and would surely recommend if your primary concern is audio clarity than viewing the baby!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","My two and half year old is potty training, and this extender has really made his hand washing go faster.",5
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","I love the way this cover fits my 6-week old, but after only having it for less than a month (I ordered it exactly a month ago), the laminated material has separated from the fabric.  With a couple more washes, it will most likely tear and then the cover will start to leak.  I'm very disappointed in the quality here.",1
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White","These diapers are very thin, but that is what I like about them. I use them as dishcloths. The thin fabric makes it easier to dry all the nooks and crannies of the clean dishes.",5

Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,This is very fast.  Love that it does not need probe covers.  Not very big and fits easily in my bag for taking with me where I need to go.,5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I ordered this Graco pack n' play to replace one that I had that I was very satisfied with. Unfortunately, they were not exactly the same. The mattress is not as sturdy as my other one and my daughter is constantly lifting it up and bending it back and even sitting under it. Don't know why this one is of lesser quality and not quite sure why one differs from the other but they did. The rest of it is ok, the colors were nice and soft.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"We liked that this was a single unit that had rails for both sides. Assembly was slightly more complicated than expected, but still took under 15 minutes. It has worked as advertised, and we have been pleased with the product.",4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in MatrixThis is the best seat! I love the 3 in 1, the fact it harnesses longer than most seats, and that it later will transition into the booster seat. My son loves his new seat and calls it his ""race car"" seat b/c of it's design. I'd highly recommend this seat to anyone with a child about to outgrow the convertable seats that only harness up to 40 lbs. Extended rear facing and extended harnessing is the safest way! I will be buying this same seat for my daughter as soon as she's big enough for it!",5
Jolly Jumper Musical Play Mat,"My daughter likes this a little, mostly to look at the colors I think. There isn't that many sounds and they are only right in the center of it, so it doesn't provide a ton of stimulation. Would be cooler if it lit up and how more sounds.",3
"Badger Basket Baby Changing Table with Six Baskets, Black","This product is ok I guess for the price. You get what you pay for. It is a frame, with no sides or bottom or back. The drawers are fabric with a cardboard (fabric covered) bottom. There are just laying on the frame, but there is no stop that will impede them to be completely pulled off the frame - either front or back.Our dresser came with two screws that were too short for their intended use - happily we had enough hardware at home to finish assembly.It also came woth a horrible smell. We put it i. The garage to offgas, but after a week, it was still smelling. After it stopped raining, we started putting the different parts outside one by one - this is when we diacovered that the smelly part was actually the flimsy plastic changing mattress. Given that we have no use for it (we already have a changing pad that we purchased separately and intend to use in the dresser), we just discarded it.",3
"Munchkin Baby Food Grinder, Light Blue",I had one of these 20 years ago but stupidly gave it away. This one holds more baby food but the handle you turn on top is attached to the baby food grinder and is very hard to put in place and it won't stay in place.  So your grinding and it keeps falling off.  It is not easy to use and is very messy.,3
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small",I've very surprised that this actually keeps everything inside.  I thot for sure it would leak but it doesn't.  Seems to hold up well in the washer.,5
"Baby Trend Deluxe Playard, Provence",Awesome playard. I bought it for 139$ on walmart. Don't buy it here at 252$ it is completely crazy when you can purchase it for 139$ at walmart.,5
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,everything is good but you can not get in the bottom when 2 car seats are on top. but this product does not suck and the price is not bad compared to any other twin strollers.,4
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,"I really liked this chair even though I just returned the one I bought.The positives are:1)the frame is well constructed.2)the cushion is very beautiful to look at.3)and the table with its pop out dishwasher safe tray is a really cool feature.The 2 negatives are:1)the foot rest could not be installed properly. It looks like an engineering glitch.2)the rollers seem to be kind of cheap and don't really roll well, even when you disengage the break levers.",2
BABYBJORN Bib for Baby Carrier 2 Pack - White,"This bib is not soft enough and  after a couple of trips with it my son's cheeks were bright red from friction. What I do, I use it as a cover for the carrier, so I do not have to wash the carrier itslef, but I also use a big Aden and Anais bamboo burpy bib between it and my baby's chin and cheeks for softness. This combination works wonders for us and even if the burpy bib gets soiled and is removed for a little while I am replacing it, my baby carrier is still protected from drooling and milk.",2
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,"I have a sandstone stacked fireplace.  I knew this or any other type adhesive probably wouldn't work and it really doesn't.  It does stick a little and I was even surprised with that.  Overall, a great product.  People don't even notice it because it matches the grout perfectly.  I may try caulking it down if my little one starts pulling at it.  I couldn't find that DAP product in any hardware store (Seal and Peel), so I may just try adhesive caulk.",5
"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","Just what everyone says about it, sturdy (HEAVY!), Narrow form, comfortable, awesome latches - if you can afford it, buy it! (3rd kid before i could afford it and cosco seats did just fine)",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"I love this hammock. I remember having similar ones when I was younger and now I get to put on in my child's nursery! It's huge and holds TONS of stuffed animals. Seriously, this things is packed and it can hold a lot more. It's now one of my favorite parts of the room :)Very easy to put up, will be easy to take down as well.I love it, I would recommend this to anyone and I will probably order another one soon.",5
Baby Clear Cut Nail Clipper Pigeon (new yellow color Made in Japan),"These nail clippers are of superb quality.  Perfectly sized and precision aligned, the sharp cutting edges make easy work of trimming your baby's nails.  If the alignment were poor, they wouldn't work.  Dull edges and they would tear or imperfectly cut.  These clippers have neither defect.  Try them.  You'll learn that Pigeon makes quality baby items.  You'll not be disappointed.",5
"WallStickersUSA Contemporary Wall Sticker Decal, Tree Branches, Leaves, Lovebirds, and Hearts, X-Large",Love this on my wall. Just a lot of separate pieces. Little time consuming but worth it.,4
My Little Pony Drink Bottle,Great drinking bottle for my four year old.  she loves my little pony and it is a good price. The lid has yet to fall off which is a plus.,5

"Munchkin 2 Pack Sesame Street Insulated Spill-Proof Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I brought this same Munchkin product at another store, and for some reason these seem way smaller. I don't dislike them and they seem functional.",1
Kirby 4 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Glenna Jean,"I searched all over for baby girl bedding that wasn't a wash of pepto fru-fruness ... this set fit the bill. Loved the bright colors and bold print. The only reason I didn't give this set 5 stars was because I was slightly disappointed that the material used was kind of rough and canvas-like. In case anyone is wondering like I was, the back of the blanket is a creme colored fleece, and that part is quite soft. The construction is excellent, and the quilt squares have reinforced stitching in the corners - nice touch. I have no doubt that this set would last through several hand-me-downs.",4
"Carters Cushysoft Blanket, Blue","If you buy this blanket, whatever you do, DO NOT FOLLOW THE WASH INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TAG. Despite the fact that it says &#34;Tumble dry&#34;, I am convinced it was meant to be line dried. I washed and dried mine according to the instructions and it came out rough and incredibly linty instead of the soft silkiness it had been before. Some of the fibers seemed almost melted. It was not a case of the drier being too hot; I had two other soft blankets in the same load and they came out just as soft as when they went in. I will be writing to the company about this.",1
"Green Eats 4 Pack Feeding Spoons and Forks , Yellow","Got these for my 13 month old son to use since he needed some toddler size utensils, these are made by Green Toys brand, which we love. They are a lot tinier than I expected though, maybe 3 inches long? I guess they are baby sized, but I thought they would be a tad larger... the quality seems to be great though!",4
babyletto Modo 5-Drawer Dresser in Espresso/White,I chose this dresser because it is modern and simple in appearance.  I assumed that for $400 the quality would match the price.  A year later the sides are bowing and the drawers are falling out.  It looks terrible and has become un-usable.  The dresser has not been overloaded or anything of the sort.  The quality is just simply terrible.  No not buy this dresser.  I am debating whether to attempt to re-inforce and stabilize it or just throw it out.  I am very upset by this purchase.Update:  Afer complaining to Babyletto they have sent me a new dresser.  I was impressed by their willingness to stand by their product and try to correct the issue.  Will report about how the replacement holds up.,2
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We bought two different baby baths before trying this product, and I wish we had just skipped to this. You don't have to worry about the baby sliding, or fitting into the right spot, plus other baby baths keep them up out of the water. With this product, you have complete control over how submerged your child is. My son is 4.5 months old, and we've been using this for about 2.5 months. He is much more comfortable and relaxed on this pillow than he ever was in a baby bath or the sink. It's perfect for us because we have a small house and small bathroom, and it doesn't take up much room. If you don't squeeze as much water out as you can before you hang it to dry, yes it gets a little mildew-smelling but no big deal. After using daily for a few months, the fabric that holds the plastic hangar is starting to unravel but I would guess we'll be able to use it for a year or so before we need to try to repair or replace. It was a great deal.",5
"green sprouts Safari Friends Backpack, Yellow Lion",Got this for my grandson 2 and half yrs old and my daughter says its too cute and has enough room for a toddler's essentials! He loves to wear it on his back per mom.,5
Safety 1st Baby's 1st Deluxe Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"The product itself is good. The kit has all the neccessary items. However, I did not recieve the product that is in the seller's picture. The color of the pouch was green, not blue. Not a huge deal, but I like to recieve the product that is advertised.",3
"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","I love this baby monitor. I bought this monitor because I was seriously going to throw the previous one out the window or in the garbage shoot because the static, not the baby, was keeping me up all night!This monitor is practically static free. In the five months i've owned it i have only heard static once. it's cute, has a night light, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time off of the charger.This monitor has been a life saver. Please buy it if your looking for a baby monitor. you'll be glad you got it.",5
"Carter's 5 Year Baby Memory Book, Woodland",This was an absolute great gift!  I was completely satisfied with this item.  The book had many features that was an absolute hit.,5
"Under The Nile Pull Over Bib, Ice Blue Snail","Under The Nile is a GREAT brand! Our family has never been disappointed with any of their products. However, we do wish they had more toddler sized items.Nevertheless, these bibs are wonderful. We've bought several different brands on Amazon such as I-Play, Green Sprouts, BabySoy, and even other Under The Nile bibs. These our probably our favorite.They pull over the head like a T-Shirt-- no snaps or buttons, and the coverage is quite ample. They fit our two years old well and the quality is superb. Considered giving four instead of five stars due to the price-- they're expensive-- but figure you get what you pay for.Our little girl wears this bib A LOT-- and not just at meals! Just got back from a trip to Whole Foods. She insisted on wearing it to the grocery store! C'mon, what more could you want??",5
Baby Spa Hypoallergenic Ultra Soft Wipes with Aloe,"These are the best and most cost effective wipes out there.  They are thicker and stronger than most of the popular wipes, which comes in handy for some of those messier diaper changes.  They are also strong enough to clean up major spills and messes that my babies make.  And all for a very reasonable cost.  Thanks for making them available to me, and with free shipping.  Who could ask for more?",5

"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I absolutely love this stroller.  It is very sturdy and easy to maneuver.  It is a great buy for the price.  I would have payed a lot more for this stroller, it is that good!",5
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,"We started out with a travel swing for our baby---not a good idea.  She was never a fan of it so I was very hesitant to spend more money on a full size swing.  I went forward with getting one because I needed some type of relief---a place to rest the baby other than her crib. We purchased this swing when our daughter was 3 months old (now 7 months).  I wish I had purchased it sooner than 3 months--this would have been a wonderful thing to have when coming home from the hospital!  This swing is beautiful and fits our decor well. In the past we used a regular baby swing with our son which is not the same as a cradle swing--this has more of a papasan chair seat which seems way more comfortable.  I love the fact that the music is soft and that there are several music/sound options--it's not the loud irritating music that most baby stuff is equipped with.  The fact that the swing can swing back to front as well as side to side is also a great feature. I love that this swing can be plugged in--no batteries needed (though you can use batteries if you like)!!The lowest speed setting is a bit faster than you would expect so as others have stated in previous reviews, weighing down the swing with a blanket does the trick. Once the baby is no longer a ""newborn"" then a blanket is not needed to weigh down the seat.  I love the fact that you can remove the seat from the frame and take it into another room without disturbing the baby--again another reason why I wish I had purchased this immediately upon my daughter's birth.  The built-in fold over blanket is cute, however it is not adequate to keep a baby warm---totally more of a neat feature rather than providing sufficient warmth. I always layer the baby with one of her soft, cuddly blankets when she is in the swing--she seems to love it. And I am surprised at how much the baby seems to still like the mobile that hangs above her head--it's been 4 months and I still catch her glancing at it.  This swing features a good amount of variety when it somes down to music, swinging direction, and the ability to remove the seat altogether. The colors are almost a pea green, dark brown (almost espresso) and burgandy--it's beautiful.We chose this swing because of the style and because of the seat being different than the traditional swing seat.  I also like that there is not a tray on this swing like some swings have--I like that my daughter uses the swing to rest and not to play and bang around--if there was a tray she'd be distracted from laying back.  I use her walker and stationary entertainer for when she needs some action--we use the swing for quiet rest time. I hope to use this swing if we have more children in the future--it was well worth the price and I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want a traditional swing or to anyone who is looking to get a very comfortable, top of the line swing.  If you are not a fan of pastel colors and want a nice looking unisex swing that also happens to be comfortable, functional, and safe go for this one!  It's pricer than some swings but as much as we've used it, it's been well worth it.  If you have a small space however, I would not recommend this swing--it is larger and takes up a good amount of room due to the fram being wide at the bottom.",5
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack Limited Edition PINK",These are awesome!!i put these on my stroller the day I received them in the mail and I have no intentions of taking them off!!!!

"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Sweater Knit Blanket, Celery/Gray ZigZag","Make sure to read the measurements on this one: it's 30x30, like a small receiving blanket. If the size suits you, this is a very nice blanket for various temperatures. It's very soft, and I found that it does fine in a low heat dryer. I would not recommend a baby blanket that had to be air-dried, that's just not practical.It's plush, but because it's cotton knit, it's not overly warm. It says sweater knit, which is vague. This is thicker, softer yarn than the thermal blankets, but the knit is finer than what I think of when I hear &#34;sweater.&#34; It's soft and fuzzy but doesn't seem too prone to snags or unravelling.This is particularly nice since so many of the softest baby blankets now are fuzzy boa-style fabrics that can just be too hot.",4
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Woof Woof, Large",We started using these when our 4 month old started rolling over at night. They are perfect! His arms are free for him to reposition himself but he still has a cover and they are easy to put on! They are a regular fixture in our sleep routine.,5

"Fisher-Price Little, Laugh, and Learn Shop 'N Learn Cart Cover",I purchased this cart cover for my one year old. We have the Floppy cover for my first child( whose two) but i liked this one because it comes with an activity tray toy that can entertain her while we shop. The extra pockets on the side make it easy to store snakes or sippy cups too. Glad that i bought it.,4
Russ Berrie 8&quot; SNOWMAN SET of 2 Beanies with Christmas Hat &amp; Scarf,"My toddler like them very much. I give him one of the toys and he takes it with himself all the time. Once it is dirty, I put it to washing mechine and give the other one to him.",4

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I bought this for my 4 month old niece.  She seems to enjoy it and it encourages her to reach.  My sister-in-law says it really entertains the baby while she is cleaning the house and the baby isn't sleeping.  The baby prefers the music and it's great to have the remote control so that she can restart the music without the baby seeing her.,5

Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- 6 Pack,"Stage 3 from Born is perfect for 5-6mo old baby. You will be able to mix 2Tbs of your favorite cereal into 6oz of mixed formula, and the nipple will have no problems with clogging. Cereals tried with this nipple at 2tbs ratio: rice, oatmeal.I am pleased with how it performs and washing (dishwasher). We used Born from stage 1-3.",5

my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
"Chicco Ct0.6 Capri Lightweight Stroller, Red","It was a good purchase for us. It's very cute and stylish with the features of the more expensive umbrella strollers.  My 25 pound 15 month old thinks it's more comfortable than his Graco Metrolite.  He was very happy to be pushed around in it and helped me pick it out. I'm 5'4"""" so I find it pretty manuverable and comfortable to push.  I'm even learning how to push it with one hand.  It's very very easy to close and open.  It fits perfectly into my CR-V (but so does everything else).  It has a sturdy and durable feel to it.  I love how it folds up and you can sling it over your shoulder. My boy is very active and loves to walk so this helps keep my hands free when I run after him.",5

Disney Cars Toddler Fitted Sheet,Three stars because the design is really cute on these sheets but the colors have faded a bit after just one wash.  Additionally the fabric and pretty rough.  They may soften a bit as we wash them more but for now they don't seem like they will be very comfy on our son's toddler bed.,3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Have enjoyed it for the last 9 and half months. Need to make sure not to fill it too much but there is a line to show you.,5

Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,"My daughter was terrified to use the potty.  This potty seat made her feel safer because her feet were grounded and she had handles to hold onto.  Also, this potty seat makes it easy for little boys to pee standing up.  I would recommend this seat.",5

Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Large,"Love these tanks! No other hands free option truly works for me like this one.  For me, this works so much better than the popular hands free bra.Often the other hands-free pumping options left me with no suction :/I have been using these tanks since starting back to work--and still successfully pumping at work/nursing at home--and little one is 8 months old now.  I always feel better pumping/nursing with a tank on...so it  kills two birds with one stone and also allows me to be prepared at work and ready to pump without any extra gear or much to maneuver.  I can even pump in the car if needed and feel the tank allows plenty of privacy.  I would hate not having this tank!Thanks for a great product!",5

"Philips AVENT Soft Spout Magic Cup, 9 Ounce, Twin, Color May Vary","My son was a breast fed baby exclusively for 10months, then he cut teeth and decided that he wanted to bite. Well, that just wasn't gong to happen. He would take a sippy cup just fine for juices and such, and had been from about 5months, but when it came down to drinking milk, the sippy cup idea didn't seem to appeal to him, nor did the bottle. Then I got him one of the Avent Magic cups.....he loved it, and still, at 2years of age, it's the only cup that he will drink milk from. We never had a problem will spilling/leaking, infact, the only problem that I have is you can't find the Avent line locally where I live.",5

The Peepee Teepee for the Sprinkling WeeWee: 5 Airplanes in Cellophane Bag,"This is a very cute and fun item, but not functional at all. This could be a good silly shower gift, but the reality is that it doesn't work. It's impossible to hold the peepee teepee in place while changing the baby. Once baby squirms the teepee falls right off. Takes more energy to try to keep the teepee in place, than to just quickly change the baby.",2
Dapper Snappers Adjustable Toddler Belt with Add-on Clips Included (Cupcakes),"My daughter is a petite little one, and at her age a belt is nearly impossible, especially when considering potty training. Easy access to use the potty is crucial at 3 1/2 years old. I've used other belts, but I ended up cleaning up a mess instead. With these, I can clip these on to a tutu, holding her pants and any other type of dress without loops up without any fuss. I just clip these on daily, and she can still use the potty by herself without any assistance from me.My daughter is getting taller, but she isn't getting any &#34;fatter&#34;, thus the need for a belt. I have total of 3, two black and one purple and they are the best invention ever! My petite little princess can wear pants without issues of them falling down or needing to roll up legs or fold down pants. Now with wearing training pants, she doesn't have the extra padding of a diaper to hold up her pants, so it's even more of a challenge! This product has solved that issue completely!!",5
"Carter's Plush Security Blanket, Bear",My daughter has had her little bear blanket from birth and has now decided to make a bear bear family.  She loves these things.,5
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany","This kit is fantastic!  I bought one previously in another store (light wood frame color) to use myself and loved it so much I bought this one for a friend who's due in a couple months. The imprint material is easy to work with, not at all messy and if you mess up, you can roll it out again and do it over. Note, you do have to PUSH your child's foot into the material fairly firmly, it's not a stamp and you can't simply touch it on the surface.  We did it while our baby was sleeping (less wiggling) and he didn't even wake up. The imprint material is actually a lightweight foam modeling material similar to stuff Crayola used to sell. The frame and matting are of good quality and all together, the kit makes a beautiful finished product that will be enjoyed for years to come.",5
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,my 7 month old daughter just loves these in her tub at bathtime. they are the perfect size and are easy for her small hands to handle. they keep her occupied and she giggles when she gets squirted with them. they are easy to keep clean and she plays with them out of the tub as well. highly recommended!,5

"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","As with most things touted as a miracle cure for your baby, the hype is a bit overblown.  This bottle does help but doesn't end reflux altogether.My three-month-old daughter has had reflux issues since she was born.  She's almost exclusively breastfed, except for one or two bottles a day of expressed milk. I thought I'd give the Dr. Brown's bottles a go, after feeding her from Born Free and Medela bottles with no discernible difference in her spitting up.  With the Dr. Brown's bottles, we did find that she spits up slightly less.  Does she still spit up?  Sure -- just not quite as much.I wash these bottles in the dishwasher (top rack), and haven't had a problem with them leaking.  Yes, there are a number of pieces that have to be cleaned for each bottle, but there are no more pieces than the Born Free bottles, and in the dishwasher it's not a big deal.  And even the times I've washed them by hand, having to wash a few pieces and use the enclosed brush hasn't been onerous.  If she were exclusively bottle-fed and I didn't have a dishwasher, I can see where these bottles might seem like a pain, but otherwise they aren't that time-consuming.A lot of the comments on the Dr. Brown's bottles seem to come down to a question of parenting style.  If you're the type of parent who values convenience above all things because you're dealing with a needy baby, especially if you don't have a dishwasher, you may well dislike the Dr. Brown's bottles (my friends in this camp rave about the Playtex dropins).  If you're instead the type of parent who doesn't mind an extra minute or less loading the dishwasher and an extra 5 seconds in assembling a bottle, if it means your child with reflux will spit up a bit less, I recommend trying one of the Dr. Brown's bottles to see if it helps your baby.",4
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer",This does exactly what it's supposed to do. Only con I can even think of is that it smells of plastic.,5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I bought the security gate to prevent our Italian Greyhound from entering parts of the house in which we don't want him, and for that it's just fine.  My only comlaint is that there is no way to leave the gate open without it swinging shut.  Even a small bungee type device would be a good addition (and I'll probably figure out something on my own).",3

"EveryDay Willow Wool Dryer Balls Gift Set of 3, Natural","Maybe I got a defective set, but these dryer balls were a miserable failure for me. I was hoping to reduce drying time; instead, on every load I tried, drying time was at least tripled. In some cases it took more than three hours to dry a regular sized load of laundry. I thought maybe the dryer had broken, but my husband insisted we try a load without the laundry balls. Amazingly enough, we were back to our normal, original drying times.I am so unhappy I spent the money on these and so unhappy I cannot return them. Also please note these do not come with the basket that's shown in the picture.--Update--The dryer times slowed down again soon after I wrote this review. The dryer repairman checked and nothing was wrong with the dryer itself. It turned out that birds had built a nest in our dryer vent chase, partially using the wool from one of these balls that had partially disintegrated. So, it wasn't totally the dryer balls' fault.",1
"Evenflo Bebek 2 Count Bottle, 8 Ounce","I started my son on Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles which he always liked and did really well with but by the time he was about 6 months old I was so sick of hand-washing (no dishwasher) all those pieces that i started looking for alternatives.  Unfortunately, my son didn't want anything to do with any of the other bottles i tried.  I tried all different types including Avent but my little man was not having it.  I finally tried Bebek (now evenflo) and he didn't even seem to notice they were different bottles, the nipple is exactly the same size and softness.Bebek used to have a slightly different style of bottle that was more boring looking but personally i liked better and the cap wasn't such a pain to put on like these new ones are but i own and still use both styles.  They're terrific bottles especially if you're sick of washing dr. brown's.",5
Soho Spring Time Butterfly Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 14 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"It appeared as though it had a satin-like finish.  Exactly opposite.

"Graco My Ride 65 DLX Convertible Car Seat, Empire","After a great deal of research, we purchased this seat because we felt it was a good combination of safety and value. My husband and I both drive Ford Explorers (mine is a 2002 two-door sport, his is a full size 2010) so we didn't think the size would be an issue. It barely fit rear-facing in the center position of the 2010 explorer, and we felt like it took a great deal of effort to get a secure fit with the LATCH compared to our Chicco Key fit 30 infant seat. We are both relatively tall, and it would not have fit in either of the outboard positions AND accommodated our need for a little extra leg room in that vehicle. We tried to install it in the 2002 with a seat belt (not equipped with LATCH) and completely abandoned the effort after a half hour of sweating and swearing. It also barely fit in the back seat of that vehicle, and we couldn't get a secure fit with the older model seat belt. Again, we had no trouble achieving a secure fit with our Chicco Key Fit 30 with a seat belt installation in this vehicle. Once the seat was securely installed in the 2010 Explorer, we were not happy with the amount of flex in the top of the car seat. We wished it had a little more reinforcing at the top.The infant head rest did not want to stay in place because it did not actually attach to the seat, and we thought it was much more difficult to unbuckle the harness than it was in our Chicco seat.On the bright side, the fabric was breathable, and our hot-natured son stayed cool and comfortable during our trip.We would have returned it, but our son expressed his opinion of the seat by exploding a diaper on our trial outing. Yes, darling, Daddy and I think this seat is crap, too. Since we are fairly certain Amazon has a no-skidmark return policy, we laundered the cover and are planning to use it in my mother's LATCH-equipped sedan, in the center position, for the rare occasions she needs a car seat.",2
"Bumkins Pacifier Clip, Gazebo","We used these on mam pacifiers, but had to go through one of the air holes which the instructions said not to do. On one hand it was good that my son couldn't get his paci off this leash. On the other had it was a negative that we couldn't take the  paci off the leash without taking it out of his mouth which I would have liked to do when transferring my sleeping baby from his car seat to crib.We bought this to replace a mam leash but I might just try a new mam leash. I wonder if it was just stretched out.",4
"Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory,Yellow",These are so handy to help out with drying bottles and parts. You won't be disappointed. We have a garden of these and love them!!!,5
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I was under the impression that these would somehow fit into the horns that came with my medlea pump...no such luck! Just be sure to order the connectors (and vale/membrane).  Wish they made smaller, but I guess I just have tiny nipples!",4
"Animal Planet 2 Count Strap Covers, White Tiger","We got these to go on the 2nd car seat we finally caved and bought... They are cute but the ones that we got at target for the first seat were better quality and had velcro that ran the full vertical length of the strap cover. these just have one little square at the top and one little square at the bottom. The material is pretty thin too, but luckily these don't take a lot a heavy wear so I think we'll be ok!",3
Disney Princess and Me Canopy Bed Set -- 5-Pc.,"I purchased this product for my daughter and, after only an hour, put it back in the box for return.  The materials and construction is among the absolute worst of any toy I've purchased in recent memory.  The plastic head board and foot board snap into the side pieces but do not form a sturdy base.  Not that it matters because the actual ""mattress"" is simply a piece of thin corrugated cardboard with tabs that slide into the plastic headboard and foot board.  It barely supports the weight of the doll and gives no purchase for the stiff quilt that accompanies the bed. (And no, the bed spread does NOT hang down over the sides of the bed, rather it sticks out like airplane wings.)  As we were tying on the canopy, two of the ribbons used to secure the fabric to the bedposts came off in our hands.Save yourself the trouble and do not purchase this item.",1
Gerber Thermal Baby Receiving Blanket- White,I love these blankets and have several of them.  They hold up well and have a nice texture.  Soft and lightweight but not thin.,5
"South Shore Angel Changing Table, Espresso","If the table did not arrive damaged , we would have given it 4 stars. The wood was chipped visibly at the front which is a shame that it looks like a discounted item given that we paid for a higher end , new one. We are not sure if this happened during packing or shipping. We did not return it because we needed it almost as soon as we got and my husband said it was a task in itself trying to get all the parts packed back properly in the box.The table itself is sturdy and elegant looking. Works great as a changing table.",3
Kiddopotamus Duomat 2 in 1 Car Seat Protector Mat,It could be a little longer at both ends.  The pouches at the bottom don't hang down low enough to be very usable.  The back of the car seat is almost too high for the mat.,4
"The First Years MiSwivel Feeding Seat, Dot to Dot","With our first kid we bought the most expensive high chair at the big box baby store -- it was called a Blossom something or other.  It was a total piece of junk. It started falling apart before our daughter was two. It was hard to clean and it sucked up loads of room. They try and suck you in by saying the high chair transitions to a big kid chair down the road. Newsflash: your kid is gonna want to sit in a REGULAR chair like everybody else when they get big enough to climb into one. You will find splat mats and wipeable placemats are the name of the game before the high chair peddlers can say ""gotcha"".  Besides -- the high chair would not fit snuggly to the side of the table for us as a big kid chair and food was getting everywhere. We have a huge kitchen so space isn't the problem for us with a high chair nor is a budget issue. We just hated that beast of a chair and wanted an alternative. We went with this feeding chair and we're thrilled. To begin, this was less than 1/4 the price of that big flashy high chair. We can buy one of these feeding chairs for our house and one for grandma's and still come out way ahead. Beyond the price are many other benefits. I'm a short person and reaching the high chair from my own chair at dinner was no fun. This chair allows my daughter to sit eye-level at the table with the rest of the family, in her own chair -- not exiled off next to the table in a different contraption. I could immediately see how thrilled my daughter was to take her place at our table the first time we used it at four months. We are big believers in family meals and how that impacts eating habits and provides a sense of cohesiveness and belonging. We credit family meals with our first daughter's early & astounding language skills because she listened to my husband and I talk to each other and to her at mealtime. This chair helps to improve that family meal experience for a little one. The chair is easy to use, it straps tightly under our very wide chairs and around the seat back as well. It isn't going anywhere. The tray fits on nicely. The straps are easy to use. The swivel is great because you can turn the chair sideways (without turning your dining room/kitchen chair) to easily feed baby while you eat at the table. My only complaint would be how hard the seat is and the fact that the back slopes in an odd place making it look uncomfortable. I put a blanket under the seat cover to cushion it a bit but I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish it came with some padding. That's about the only complaint we have. We're thrilled we did not get the big high chair. You really do learn so so much with child #1 and you learn to make smarter, cheaper choices the second time around. :) UPDATE: WE HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A FISHER-PRICE FEEDING CHAIR/SEAT AND LIKE IT BEST. WE SENT THIS ONE TO OUR SCREENED-IN PORCH TO HAVE MEALS OUT THERE WITHOUT MOVING THE EVERYDAY CHAIR. THE FISHER-PRICE CHAIR IS A FLAT SEAT AND BACK AND EVEN WITHOUT A CUSHION MY DAUGHTER IS UNDOUBTEDLY MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE NEW FEEDING SEAT. I STAND FIRM THAT THESE FEEDING CHAIRS/SEATS ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE HIGH CHAIRS.",4
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","This product is a life saver! We love it. Also, I would buy it from Amazon rather than a vendor cause it has really great customer service. The first one we bought from Amazon went to the wrong address and they immediately refunded it! So we bought it again. Also, we choose the standard shipping (the cheapest one) and we ended up receiving the stroller much earlier than expected!",5
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",This sheet is great. It is soft and comfy. It perfectly fits the new Dream On Me Pack N Play mattress I just bought. Both items fit perfectly into my Graco Pack N Play. We needed a thicker mattress for longer sleeping.,5
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","I did much research before purchasing a double stroller and couldn't be happier.  It is easy to use, has the best sunshades I've ever seen and folds easily.  My children are 3 years and 14 months and are very comfortable riding in this stroller.  My one complaint is the lack of compatibility with the Chicco infant carrier.  With the popularity of this car seat I believe that Baby Jogger is really missing the boat.",5
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"These bottles are amazing. They can be a pain to clean sometimes, but they keep gas bubbles out of babies tummy and worth it! I like the wide set rather than standard which makes the bottles easier to hold (just my opinion)",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"As always shipping was faster than expected! We got this to free up some floor space in my son's(4 months) room. Who knew kids accumulate stuffed toys to fast! Anyways, this is perfect! It's big and stretchy! Will buy again for my future kids when they come :)",5

"Peg-Perego Aria Twin Stroller, Java","This stroller is comfortable, and it fits everywhere. After researching a lot I decided to go with this one, because was on sale and within my budget.  The front wheels it is hard to turn at the beginning but nothing that some grease and dw40 wouldn't fix. With this stop make noise and start turning easier. I am glad i got this one. My 2 1/2 year and 3 month old baby enjoy it a lot..",4

"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Green, 0-12 Months",This was helpful for double nursing when I needed to stand or nurse at night. But it was so bulky I fiund it too inconvenient to mess with most of the time. Great construction though.,3
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This newborn rock'n play sleeper has been fantastic.  My daughter has slept in it for nearly every nap and night since she was born and loves it.  It is also super easy to fold up and bring somewhere - we had to stay in a hotel for a weekend and it was so convenient to fold it up, throw it in the car and travel to the hotel - also have brought it to friends and families house during visits (much better than the bulky pack n plays I used to tote around with my first born).  Highly recommend!!",5
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat - Closeout,Bought this car seat for our 2nd vehicle.  Easy to install and easy daily use.  Our toddler seems very comfortable.  Great seat for the price!  Seat reviews well for safety on other sites.,5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This diaper pail does not stink and is so easy to use!!  Our church uses the diaper genie, and it stinks like crazy!  But this one smells nice all the time.  The refills are so easy to put in.  They come 3 to a box, and they last a long time.  Our son just turned 2 months old yesterday, and we just had to replace the refill for the first time!  That means that if we keep this rate up, we won't have to buy another box of refills until he is 8 months old, since the pail comes with the first set already installed.",5
"MAM 3 Pack Anti-Colic Bottle Boy, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Love this bottle since it's the only bottle my son will drink out of, the nipple shape is great since it matches the pacifier (MAM) he uses. He was a breastfed baby and we needed a bottle to give him on occasion for pumped milk and he would NOT suck on other nipples, but would this b/c it is just like his pacifier.  He still struggled b/c he suffered from &#34;nipple confusion&#34; which I'm still not convinced exists...they just want the real deal, not something silicone or not real to drink from-it's not confusion its just being opinionated :)I give this product 4 stars b/c of the anti-colic ability of the base and the nipple shape, but if I were to rate it on all the parts, I should be giving it a 2-3 stars...it has SO many parts to clean and put back together and it not put back together just right it leaks horribly.  It leaks from the base and the top screw on lid, even if it seems you have screwed it on correctly it might not be.  It's really not so awful, but you have to double check everything to make sure you aren't about to dump milk all over your baby, which we have done in the middle of the night requiring a clothing change for him and for myself.Outside of this great bottle, just wish the rubber nipples were available more readily...apparently they exist, but never could find them.",4
"Bright Starts Walk-A-Bout Walker, Cute Frog","Cute and my 6 month old granddaughter likes it, but when I move it by lifting it, (when she is not in it!) it changes the height  so I have to fix the height again before she goes in it the next time.",3
"Itzy Ritzy Bib, Burp and Bath Cloth, Little Miss Zig Zag","I currently only use this as a burp cloth, but now my baby has started to drool, I'll be able to use it as a bib as well. One less item to carry!  Lightweight fabric but bobbled after one wash. Apart from the bobbling, it's a good product.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We got this just for my son to chew on instead of anything he could cram in his mouth. He loved the feel of it I guess. It's rubber but  a strange type of rubber unlike anything I had seen before. I even took a chew on it once just to see what the fuss was about. It was slightly harder than I though it would be but clearly soothing to his little sore gums.It washed up easily but never really seemed to get &#34;dirty&#34; although it likely never even seen any dirt. Today it looks as new as we got it although some of the paint has worn off which is fine because its non toxic.,5
"NoJo Night Light, Butterfly","I bought this item as a night lamp as we are expecting a baby soon. The flower is cute and quality is really good. However, the light is too bright. The butterfly doesn't cover the light fully. Further it is an yellow light as well. This is never pointed out in the description. Disappointed with the light but going to retain this as it looks really cute.",2
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"This is a good price for an extra-wide gate.  For what it is, it's fine.  But, as indicated in other reviews, the room sizes it works well for are limited.  My doorway span is 48 inches and we made do, but this gate isn't really made for that width.  Were my door frame slightly larger, the extra expander would've been fine, but it's just not quite wide enough.  Additionally, because we had to almost retro-fit the gate, the sturdiness of the gate is lacking.  (Not sure how this would be affected if my doorway were a size the gate fit well.)  I have a sneaky and motivated dog, and he's been able to push the gate over a couple times when I haven't been watching.  So, be cautious of that as well.  Overall, it's working for me now, but I wouldn't buy it again.",3
NUK Bottle Drying Wand with Ergonomic Handle,"I use this item every single day. I find it very useful, but there are a few minor improvements I would like to see. Thus, I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5.This item has been invaluable to dry bottles either after handwashing, or after removing from the dishwasher when they still have some water/condensation on the inside. We have used it on a variety of bottle types and sizes, and it always works well. The microfiber material absorbs well, and you can dry multiple bottles at a time. The shape and size makes it pretty easy - it is much, much better than using paper towels for this task.The couple VERY MINOR changes I would like to see:  1) At the top - where the red nubs are - it would be better if this was also some sort of absorbent material. 2) The package instructions said to wash before using, but did not give instructions on how to wash. That was a little confusing, and I would still like to know how to wash this item!Overall, this has been a very useful item in our house, with just some very minor misses.",4
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"I purchased this as a gift to myself and for a friend because we both enjoy scalp massages. We both enjoy the product, however, we were a little disappointed that all three were plain silver color, rather than different colors. It provides a nice, gentle scalp massage. The tips of the prongs are rounded, so there's no pinching or scraping against your skin. The only downside is that it is somewhat flimsy, so you can't get quite as intense a massage. In any case, we both like it as a way to relax and enjoy a light massage.",4
Tranportation Blue Nap Mat,"Using for my 2 yo at daycare for nap time. Have used for 3 weeks, has held up fabulously through the washer and dryer. Very fluffy and soft. Would definitely recommend.",5
"Foscam FBM3501 Digital Video Baby Monitor - 2.4 Ghz with Pan/Tilt, Nightvision and Two-Way Audio/Video Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (White/Gray)","We are searching for a replacement for our older Summer Infant video monitor which has become a bit crackly and dependent on it's power cord, even though we can still hear our son's breaths. However, I have yet to find a new monitor that offers the same audio quality, which is shocking considering these are baby monitors--wouldn't audio be the primary feature?This monitor must be turned up so loud to hear our son that we hear the constant his of poor quality speakers the entire time the monitor is in use.As well, the night time video quality is very poor. I expect a bit of graininess and vagueness from a night vision monitor, but I couldn't even distinguish my son's bright blond head from his dark sheets and stuffed animals.",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",it is my first carrier and i'm very happy with my purchase. It is super comfortable. Yesterday i wore this for almost 4 hours when i took my son out....he slept pretty much through out and wasn't cranky. He is 3 months old.,5

"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","overall it is just OK for its price, the joints are not clean cut,  it has some really rough edges, we had to grind down and sand paper it so it leaves a smooth edges.  you can feel sprinter when you pass your fingers through it which is not baby friendly at all.  And also we got a different color than what was picture, we didnt want to hassle with the return so we kept.",2

"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Soft Starter Spill Proof Cup 2 Handle, 6 Ounce, Horizontal, Colors May Vary","My son is only 5.5 months but is practicing with these cups. They don't leak and have a semi-soft spout (not a silicone spout).  Baby seems to know how to use and chews the spout often (teething). Just wish the cup had markings indicating the number of ounces.Oh, and yay because I got boy colors! First time that has happened!",5

I rent my house, so putting carpet in was something that I couldn't do. My whole house is tile, so this was a good solution. My 9month old sits, stands and falls down on these all day long and doesn't get hurt. The price of these online is expensive. I bought these for $20 a pk at a K-Mart.

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, White, Mesh","I would never buy a Baby Bjorn again. The carrier is overpriced for what it is. It is, in all effects, a newborn/infant carrier. It's a LOT of money to lay down for a carrier that you can use for less than a year, and in many cases it is much less than a year.The carrier also poses some comfort/positioning concerns. For the person wearing the carrier, it just isn't very supportive. It's better than older models, but still not comfortable by any means once your baby weighs more than 10 lbs.The carrier also hangs baby by his/her crotch, which is not good for their hips and spine. There are much better options out there, and most of them cost significantly less than this carrier.",1
Summer Infant Body Support Pillow,"Genius!I bought it when I was 2 and 1/2 months pregnant and it changed my sleep overnight!My back and hips felt so much more comfortable, it was a relief right away and I really did sleep better.Now with my belly growing, it's nice to snug the pillow side under my belly and prevent my waist and ligaments from pulling.I drag it along to the living room daily for my nap, use it every night and am wondering how to pack it on my babymoon as I wouldnt dream of not taking it with me :-)Plus, it can be used for the breastfeeding and as a cuddling cot for your baby later on...",4
"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery","Once I laid eyes on this baby book there was no turning back. I knew I wanted it the minute I saw it. I am so happy with this purchase. It is everything I hoped for and more. The first day it arrived, I started filling stuff in. It is so beautiful...all the pages are a little different with the design and it is so pretty. The pages are thick to prevent ink bleeding through which is great. I cant wait for my daughters arrival so I can fill out more! The overall quality of this book is amazing. I am in total awe over it and I would recommend it to everyone! I also love how detailed it is and everything it has you fill out. No details will be left out and I will be able to record EVERYTHING. It goes all the way to five years old. Lots of record keeping! Oh and did I mention how beautiful it is?! (I got Camille).",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","We bought this booster for my daughter since she was growing out of the carseat in my husband's car. I really liked all of the safety features. My daughter says it is comfortable and she is able to fall asleep and stay asleep comfortably thanks to the side impact features. We liked it so much that when she grew out of the carseat in my car, we purchased another one. The only complaint I have is that it can be a little tricky to buckle up. I have to reach all the way across my daughter and she can't quite get it herself yet. However, her safety is my number one priority.",4

I recommend this product and if I had to would buy it again.,5
Child to Cherish Marshmallow Clay Handprint Ornament,"This is a great way to create a keepsake of your child.  I plan on making one for all my children (maybe even some for the grandparents!).It was easy to use and the instructions were great.The marshmellow clay as a little strange and is very light and fluffy when it dries.  I expected it to be more firm.  It seems like it would be really easy to just break in half.  However, there is a benefit to this, as the handprints made when I was a kid weighed about 20lbs and shattered if they fell.  This will be easy to store, slightly protected, and won't make my tree fall over!I would definitely reccommend this product.  It would just require some protected storage (as do many Christmas ornaments).",5
Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok,"This product did not work with our toilet because of the angle of the toilet bowl.  There was no way of knowing this until we took it out of the box and tried to install it.  We ended up with a swing-shut toilet lock from Target instead, which would probably work for a wider variety of toilet shapes.  (Who ever knew there was a variety of different bowl shapes in the first place?)",1
"Mud Pie Baby EiEiO Teether Blankie, Horse","I ordered this as a gift and was very disappointed.  The description says it is 8"" x 9"", which it probably is if you measure from the tip the ears and the bottoms of the feet.  The blanket itself is 5"" x 5"".  It is not a ""blankie"" as stated in the description, but a small scrap of cloth with teething items attached.",1

Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I purchased these and received them today! I have been on a search for baby food containers for my homemade food. These are just what I was looking for, and I wish I would have purchased them sooner. The lid fits very snug. I previously used a regular ice cube tray then wrapped it in plastic wrap to find my food freezer burnt. So far my only complaint is the size. I assumed like most freezer trays these were 2 oz cubes. However, they are only 1 oz. My little munchkin loves to eat and we could easily go through half a tray in one sitting. They should make 2 oz trays, and they would be absolutely perfect!",4

Combi Urban Baby Carrier Yellow,This carrier works great. I have a 20# 6 month old & he does wonders in it. The only downfall is the strap kind of rubs my neck & makes it a bit uncomfortable. I have tried the native slings & they SUCK!!! Hope this helps.,3

Evenflo Aura Select Travel System - Caroline,"I received this travel set yesterday. We ordered it in Pink Cuddle Bear. I was soooo amazed. Wow! Assembly was sheer simplicity! My husband was at work and I assembled the entire set by myself in less than 20 minutes... and I have carpal tunnel in my left wrist. Again, simple. The picture just did not give this set justice, it is much much nicer when you actually see it. The pink is so soft and pretty and the materials used to make these items are very nice, not cheap at all. I feel as though I have purchased a Mercedes for the price of a Kia. The stroller is very sturdy and comes with plenty of bells and whistles and the car seat is definately deluxe. The car seat fits easily on top of the stroller to create a travel system that will be PERFECT for your little angel. I love it and I can't wait until my baby girl arrives so that she can enjoy it too. You will definately get your moneys worth plus much more with this one. This set is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!!",5
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,"My baby loves this Jumperoo.  It's bulky so if you are tight on space that may be an issue, but other than that no complaints.",5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"I bought this product to add some moisture to my child's room because of frequent nose bleeds and a pellet stove that sucks all the moisture out of the air. (sorry being honest here)  and I LOVE IT!!  Great for a small room but for the price you could get two for a larger room.  I love the swivel spout and the option to change it to blow in two directions. Can't go wrong on this product.  My only problem though is the product description states it has an auto shut off and it hasn't shut off since I bought it and I've had it running all night.  Maybe it's because I leave my son's door, not a big deal for me though.  My child states he sleeps better and doesn't wake up dry anymore.",5
"Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Red",When I first ordered this model they sent one that 2012 on the box and my daughter in law went right to reviews and read that this newer model has better safety features. I exchanged that model for this one; the latest one just out. My daughter in law and my son are both happy so I am too.,5

"Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair, Oasis","Worth every penny.  The best highchair I have ever used. The designers thought of everything. I would suggest that if you are looking for highchair look no further because this is truly a great buy and it might cost a few dollars but it's the 5th and last highchair I will ever buy. If it cost $400.00 it would still be a deal. We use it as a seat, craft center, kitchen island, and even a place for your child to learn how to refine there fine motor skills while eating.",5

Medela Supplemental Nursing System,"I suffer from IGT (insignificant glandular tissue) and only produced about 3oz of milk a day (yes, I've tried every prescription/herb/remedy out there). My daughter was only about seven weeks old when she started refusing to nurse except for at night. It was devastating to me. I want to breastfeed my daughter more than anything! My natural birth turned into a c-section...and now I couldn't even breastfeed. I became an exclusive pumping mama and was connected to the pump for hours a day! It made me really really depressed. I was doing some research about IGT and discovered the SNS. It was seriously like Christmas for me, I ordered it the second I found it! My daughter was four months old when it arrived and had not been breast fed for almost a month. It definitely took A LOT of patience and dedication, but she has not had a bottle since the day it arrived! It has been the most incredible gift to be able to be able to breastfeed my daughter, even though I don't make enough milk. I would recommend the SNS to anyone who really wants to have that closing BFing relationship with their child. Breastfeeding is about SOO much more than just the milk. Thank you Medela for making it possible for women like me to nurse our sweet babies!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I bought one a couple of years ago for my then two-year-old, then passed it on to a friend.  But then decided to go to Disney World for the kid's 5th birthday this spring.  Stroller rental was outrageous, and my friend had donated my old one to Goodwill.  So I bought this.  My daughter was about 43 inches and 42 pounds.  She was possibly too tall for it and seemed a little hunched up, but she said it was comfortable--and the fact that she repeatedly fell asleep in it attests to that fact.Anyway, great stroller, easy to push, tall handles so you don't hunch over.  Storage is a bit of a pain with the X frame behind the basket, but you get used to it pretty quickly.Definitely recommend--lightweight and sturdy",5
Go Diego Go Rescue Jump Fleece Throw,"We bought this for our grandson who is a new big brother, and it's his very favorite blanket now!  It's just the right size, and it's Diego, so it's a hit.  Thanks for having his available for us.",5

E-Ware Dual-Layer Multi-Purpose Large Food Steamer (EW-5K118),"I was looking for a solution to help make baby food. Some of the criteria was: I did not want to spend too much, wanted a multi-purpose gadget (given I can cook adult portions in it too), and BPA Free - and this  steamer  was it. When it arrived I wasn't that thrilled about the size, it takes some good counter space, it's bigger than I would like, but I like the idea of a multiple layers! The timer is useful, set it and forget it. The plastic is easy to clean. But because it's on a bulky side, it's not so easy to move the base around and clean it after each use. As I am writing this, I read some of the reviews about rust for the first time, mine doesn't have any yet. I wonder if removing the water from the base reservoir after each use would help prevent rust but again it's a bit bulky to move around.",4

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"Easy to clean, easy to set up, cute design. Like that I can take the tray off with one or both hands. Top tray piece comes off for easy cleaning.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples.  I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle.  The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple.  These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings.  They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either.  They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced.",2
Stella Mamma organic silicone necklace-phenix black(no sales tax),"It is not shiny like others I have seen, but still an interesting & fun design! My son picked it up off my chest & began chewing on it before I had a chance to show it to him! He loves it & I really like wearing it too!",5
Good Night Bear - 5 Piece Bedding Set,"My husband and I are expecting our first baby in July.  We don't know the sex, so trying to find a suitable bedding set was very difficult.  We looked at other sets that were double the price and really didn't offer much more.  After going to BRU to see it in person we bought it on the spot. It is absolutely beautiful! At our BRU they had the lamps and mobiles.  Decorating the nursery has been fun and easy so far. We are very pleased with this product and look forward to adding the other pieces soon.",5
BornFree 9 oz. Wide Neck Glass Bottle,"I switched over to Born Free when bubs was 4.5 months because I started to become really concerned about other chemicals leaking into the milk due to BPA free plastic baby bottles.  Researched for quite a while and glass bottles are quite expensive.  I switched from the Avent system and was quite concerned that baby wouldn't like them.  It took him a few days to adjust to the speed of the new nipples but he is fine now (stage 2, he is almost five months). I was also concerned about the venting system working like Avent so that he wouldn't get gas in his stomach.  Let me assure you that the system is different but also limits the gas, you can see the bubbles rising to the surface just like Avent.  When I got the bottles I was pleasantly surprised that they placed a cap like insert with the bottle so that you can close up the bottle without the nipple.  With Avent you must buy these separately.  Also, these bottles really are leak free as long as you screw them tight enough.  No more annoying milk leaks after shaking up the bottle. The mouth is also very wide so easy to make formula in.  The bottles that I got were not from Amazon (found cheaper. $7.50 for a 9oz) but another provider so the ml markings were engraved in the bottle.  This is nice because they will never rub off, but also a bit hard to see in the dark.  The bottle has five parts all together which is a bit annoying to clean and put together but because I wanted a good quality glass bottle that is what you have to live with.  As other reviewers have mentioned you can tell this is good quality glass, very thick.  It is not Pyrex though so be careful heating or going from extreme temperatures. I hope to save these bottles if I have another baby.  Also, a good tip for parents-to-be.  It is not necessary to get the smaller size 4 or 5oz bottles just because your baby is a newborn.  Just buy the 9oz bottles and don't fill it up as much.  When your baby hits about 3-4 months they will eat a lot more and it is not worth filling up two small bottles when all you need is one big bottle.  I have six size 9oz bottles and that gets me through one day and a night.  I look forward to using the sippy spouts and transforming the bottles to good chemical free sippys.  I am a bit disappointed in Avent for not making glass bottles.  I chose the system because I needed to pump milk so bought into the whole bottle system because of that. You can tell which companies are actually concerned about the quality of their products and the well being of their consumers by giving choices. I don't see how it would be difficult for Avent to offer glass bottles.  I think the issue is profits, plastic bottles are more cheaper to make than glass.Also, plastic BPA free bottles become scratched up and it is hard to make sure the the inside is clean because of the plastic.  With the glass, you can feel that squeaky clean feeling and can see that the bottle is clean.  One other point, you can pour very hot water in these and let them cool to put formula in later, without worrying about chemicals leaching into the water.  Only con: the bottle is heavier but not an issue for me.",5

Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"After reading some of the reviews I thought I was going to need to brush up on my calculus to install the rail.Its actually pretty easy. The only &#34;trick&#34; is how the straps are configured. Originally I accidently put the straps on the same side instead of across, from rail to rail. It was very easy to detach the straps and reposition. It took, maybe, 20 minutes to properly install it.After installing under the mattress, I put my full, grown man body weight against the rail and it held surprisingly well. It didn't really budge at all. I'm very confident that my kid that weighs about 10% of my body weight will stay put in bed at night with these in place.",5

Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"The good:  My kids love their new 'light guys' and we no longer have to leave their room lights on all night.  Its easy to take along for travel, and I plan to use them on car trips as well, since my daughter does not like being in the car in the dark.The bad: I ordered 2 lights originally.  One of them was defective - the black case on the AC adapter was broken so that it could open easily, exposing the wires inside.  I got a replacement and that one had the same problem!  The next replacement was fine, however.The base charger is nice, but its hard to tell if the light is actually charging or not since slightly shifting the nightlight while it is on the base can change the indicator light from red (not charged) to green (charged).You can only use the 15 minute timer with the blue light.  It would be nice to be able to turn on the timer independently of the light color.Leaving it on blue, the battery easily lasts 12 hours or more.  However, the red or changing color modes seem to only last a few hours at the most.  So we end up using blue all the time rather than enjoying the other colors.",3

"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","Just recently received & assembled this 'door chest'.Jan 2010. FYI there is a huge problem in the shipping of it. It is so heavy that the box falls apart during the shipping & that should be addressed!!! It was sent back before I even got it the first time. I was not notified - I HAD TO CALL TO SEE WHERE IT WAS! But, I reordered & it arrived - AGAIN the box torn, but all pieces were there - so be aware!! It does take TIME & Patience to assemble. TWO 'CALM' heads would be helpful when doing the assembly ! :) But it does fit together nicely - drawers glide nicely, door adjusts easily.I looked around for awhile and this is a nice size, looks very nice, & really does the job for the cost.",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,Practiced ahead of time before we had to actually coordinate it right before we got on the plane and everything worked great. It was a graco carseat and we were not comfortable letting him ride in it...but it did save our backs and free up some hands.,5

KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,Purchased for a crib that is no longer manufactured and the convertible components were not available.

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","We tried another sling for our first baby, and when we discovered the Mobi we found out how inferior all other slings are.The Mobi isn't a sling; it's a wrap. The way the wrap works (which is described in the instructions that come with the Mobi means that the baby is held securely, close to mom in a way that makes it impossible for them to fall out, while supporting them in a way that is safe. Our Mobi wrap was recommended by our pediatrician, and she was right!We've shared this with other new parents, and every one of them has loved it as well. After using ours, I know at least three other families who later bought a Mobi.You won't be disappointed!",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I bought this for my daughter hoping she'd be interested in carrying her own toys and knick knacks so I don't have to pack a full diaper bag now that she's older, but maybe b/c she's still under 2, she's not all that interested in carrying this thing even if it's empty, just for fun. Hopefully she'll grow into it and she'll use it for several years. I don't know how durable it is, but it's pretty cute and seems sturdy and well made. I don't like how the Owl's eyes are made of felt, they will definitely get dirty over time and that part is not so durable and will be hard to clean compared to the rest of the backpack which probably can be just cleaned with some water and a cloth externally. I'm not sure if the whole thing can/should be thrown into the washer?",3
Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,"I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy.  This makes my snap n go indispensable.  It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light.  One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller.  If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat.  I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint.  It handles pretty well.  It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated.",5

Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,This gate doesn't clamp into the sides of our opening that well.  A visiting dog rushed into it and bent the metal.

"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","Paid $50 for this same item in a different print at Target, so I was excited when I found this one for $42.49 online.

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I love this pail. It takes regular trash bags and contains the odors. It's not exactly odor proof, but you won't smell anything unless you leave it for more than two weeks. I keep a spray can of room freshener next to the pail and when I get a stinking diaper, I give the pail lid (the inside blue part) a quick spray and everything is fine. I'm happy with the purchase and since it was only 15 bucks, you can't beat the pricing. - Months later and still love it!!!",4

"Thermos FUNtainer Food Jar, Disney Princess, 10 Ounce",Product is good but it is not the right price compared to the walmarts or the other big box stores where you could feel the product and buy. Though I wish I could give better rating but for the pricing disadvantages I would give only 2 stars.,1
Evenflo Journey Elite Travel System - 3 Little Bears,"Actually bought a different color, but same model. Not as nice as I hoped. Not exactly ""one handed use"" as the product boasts. Product has inconsistent performace. Sometimes it has trouble unfolding, sometimes it has trouble latching the carseat into it. About the only consistencies are that it usually os fold up easily, and the car seat latches into the base for the car easily. The carseat base for the vehicle is not adjustable. My newborn head was flopping all around. I had to be risky and prop the base a bit with a cushion. (NOT GOOD). The ""one handed steering"" doesn't manuever as well as I hoped. I either have to strong- arm it or stop what I'm doing and use two hands. Overall, I wish I was more educated so I could choose a model that would be better for me, or spent more money on a better modl with better quality.",2
"Rumparooz Reusable Cloth Pocket Diaper, Ladder 6, Aplix",I am pretty new to the whole cloth diaper thing so I don't really have anything to compare these to but I love love love them.  They are really absorbant and my son seems to like them.  The only thing I think could be an issue for alot of mom's is that I don't think it is likely to actually last until potty training for most kids.  My son is a very tiny 22 month old.  He weighs 21 pounds and wears 18 month cloths (though the waist is almost always to big) this diaper fits him great! He has two snaps left for the closure tabs and is on the last set of the rise snaps.  I think most 18 to 24 month olds will probably barely fit into these.  That being said they are absolutely wonderful!!  I think even if you can only use them the first year to year and a half they are well worth it.,4

"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","I've had this Ktan since my daughter was a new born. She is now almost nine months old and I use it at least 4-5 times a week. It is so easy to use and comfy for her and I. She had awful reflux as an infant so keeping her upright was a big deal to help. Not to mention she was ON me so she was much happier. Se still loves it. I will use it for at leat six more months or until she is too big for it.  Mommys, you can even discretely nurse in it! It is the number one baby product I would recommend to every mommy! It washes well, and can easily be stuffed in a diaper bag or purse, unlike the other bulky carriers. Get it, love it!",5
Gerber 4 Pack Flannel Burpcloth Set (Neutral),"I must have 20-30 of these Gerber flannel burp cloths because my baby is a HUGE spitter. These cloths work great for the amount of spit up a normal baby has, but not for one who spits up copious quantities. For my baby they only make it through one spitting episode before they have to be washed. They also don't wick the moisture up, so the spit tends to run down the cloth instead of being absorbed. We still use them as lap clothes for the baby though. If you have a heavy spitter you can make cute burp clothes by using a cloth diaper and adding pretty ribbon to it. They are super absorbent and mean less washing of your own clothes.I have seen other Moms use these whose babies don't spit up ounces at a time and they worked great for them which is why I am giving these 4 stars.Pros: InexpensiveGood sizeCons: Not super absorbent",4
"KF Baby Animal Soft Sole Booties, for 3-12 Months - Cow","They are super warm!! But, my they were HUGE on my baby's feet!  I wish they had a 3-6 size!  Other than that, they have anti-skid stuff on the bottoms, and are super soft on the inside!",3
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Medium/Large","I love these inserts for my sons diapers.  I use fuzzi buns diapers and I find these to be absorbent, sturdy and some of the best I have tried.  I also use a hemp soaker and love it just as much, but this one is pretty great too.  I agree with the other review about it catching lint, but taking a few extra steps, that issue can be eliminated.  I have a front facing lint catcher and if I don't make sure my catch and the area in front of the door are clean my inserts come out with beards.  A little bit of cleaning and prep has minimized my lint problem.Overall these inserts hold up pretty well, they are one of the few don't go bald after a dozen washes and don't get skinny.  I have used them for about a 10 months and a few are wearing but that is expected with constant use.",4
"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","I was initially really excited about these sippy cups because my babies (twins) took to them really quickly.  Probably becaue the spout felt very similar to the nipple on their bottles.  It made the transition away from bottles easier.  Unfortunately they didn't last very long.  We used them for about 2 weeks and because the spout was so soft, the kids started to nibble on the tips and after a few days I noticed tiny holes in the spout getting larger and larger with every use.  Now the milk just pours right out and the spill proof spout is no longer spill proof.  I don't want to bother buying replacement spouts because they are almost the same cost as the entire learner cup.  I feel like I wasted my money on this product because I didn't get much use out of it -- 2 weeks was definitely not worth the money.",2
Traffic Light Lamp,"The lamp (or more of a night light) is adorable maybe a little small, the only thing I don't like is it blinks and you can't turn off the blinking.",3
Bright Starts Flutter and Link Friend,A good product overall..it is a bit low for hanging in the car seat and you have to be careful with it.. However i often take it out and let my daughter play with it as she loves to chew on the wings..the wings are made of cloth with some ruffling material inside that is noisy and keeps my daughter interested..the downside is that it is light pink in color which does get dirty and i dont think we can machine wash it bcz not all the plastic taggies can be taken out.,5

"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","Love that its red & super visible in parking lots, etc.Love that its easy to fold & light!Love the shade.... & how both car seat & stroller make a little egg to protect the baby.Don't like how it connects to car seat. It is a design flaw that should be fixed in next model. Car seat wobbles. Because the car seat is heavy, its hard to maneuver onto the stroller pegs that it has on either side.  I'm a smaller woman, so its a problem for me, it may not be for others.... but the pegs you have to aim at suck.  I'm still over all happy.  Stroller on its own rocks!",4
Munchkin Caterpillar Spillers Stacking Cups,My little girl loves these.  She loves bath time only if there are toys! :) She just loves to play with the water and these cute little cups.  And they stack together so they hardly take up space.,4
Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,rubber balls pinch the hairs on the back of my neck and daughter wasn't so interested anyway.  Wanted to love it...  Too expensive.,2
Flingshot Flying Monkey,Bought this for my Dad when he was stressed out at work. He had a blast with it and still uses it to help release stress when they are having a hectic day at the office.,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is an excellent product.  It is well built, it being used for the second time and has not lost a single toy yet.  My son loved the saucer and he still likes to get in it even though he is 2 1/2.  My daugther who is 6 months will easily stay inside the dish for at least 45 minutes.  Plenty of toys and the chair is easily swivled.  Great buy!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I purchased the Diaper Genie Easy Twist Away, well it was part of a shower gift. We've returned one, as the catch for the cover(with the twist) broke. This is a piece less than a centimeter long and maybe one millimeter wide. It's what helps lock the cover down.The second one, seemed to work great........then......after changing one of the plastic inserts, which we'd brought at Baby's R Us, where it was ordered for us, the Genie would not twist and make it's renknowned sausages, with each hermetically sealed diaper. It instead would just drop the diapers down into a giant sac below, no secure twist to separate the diapers.Now the instructions say to push the diaper down till the lower hinges grab the diaper, about 4-5 inches. The instructions also say to turn it an extra 4 times to sort of prime the unit for the first one or two diapers. BUT none of this has worked, the twisting that separates diapers  just won't work. We're trying the magic number four and it's not reliable, sometimes six or seven , which consumes mucho expensive  insert plastic....if the manufacturer ""knows"" it will take up to 8 turns.....then say so and reduce the price or increase the amount of insert plastic.Oh......I'm with everyone else. The cutter is hit or miss. Trust us, we turn it while holding the button down as prescribed and tried every combination of turning more , turning less, turning after button pops up, but instead, again, i'm left using three hands, me, husband and scissors to free the bag, just to have the giant sac problem repeat itself......we want this to work, it just doesn't.Here's our guess and believe me we're getting on the horn with Playtex. The Old unit which took a funnel, has gazillions of insert packages left on the market. The new unit has packages labeled Easy Twistaway. Funny thing is the new Diaper Genie Pail unit (twist away) seems to work best with the old funnel Diaper Genie Pail inserts. You can look at the inserts and clearly see a difference in the design of the 5-8 dollar packages. One has little notches spaced every 1.5 inches. along the outer circumference of the insert package. The other (the Easy Twist) insert, has the raised notches on the inner edge of the package. The unit seems designed to turn the older types not the new types. What's up?The directions clearly indicate on the insert being UNIVERSAL, providing directions for the older funnel type and the newer EASy TWist One hander......well there's nothing one handed about a unit that won't work it's own disposable proprietary insert. This is almost clearly a product recall issue for those of us who are having this dillema of the big sac of diapers versus the designed sausages. I hope Playtex soon acknowledges this problem. It's not so ""simple"" as twist four times. Plain observation shows that units are being sold that are not universal with their own inserts. I think it's a way of selling off inserts until they extinguish the old units.........anyhow the new Easy Twist does not work unless you have the right inserts.......or maybe they're manufacturing the insides of the Easy Twist, with the Funnel type tops......Anyhow beware, we're gentle handed people and this unit is supposed to be a no brainer, not a feet in packaging engineering , santitation and empiric science......it's supposed to work most of the time, and any problems, should be informed to the consumer by the manufacturer.........Maybe enough of us can get this fixed. I like the product genuinely, smells good, sanitary-ish......etc........but I'd like it best not in ""theory"" but in practice..",2
PiddlePad Waterproof Seat Liner,"It takes 3 seconds to make sure the piddle pad is going to be under your child before putting them in, oppose to an hour to wash the whole car seat.  Remember on vacations it is sometimes not easy to wash your childs car seat.  Do you really want them sitting in a messy seat?  It is perfect for car rides, airplane rides ( when its not that easy to change a diaper ), and in the stroller.  I am pregnant with the second and already have them in the mail and on their way to me.  I recommend them to everyone!!!",5
"Argington Sahara Convertible Crib, White","I can only echo what others have written here.  I had a horrible experience with Argington.  Everything was backordered, which was not disclosed when I made my purchase.  I had to beg them to ship every item---I barely had the crib in time for my baby, despite having placed the order more than three months early.  Some items I didn't have even nine months later, when after months and months of them promising to ship the items to me (always with me inquiring---where's my stuff?  no one from their end ever bothered to contact me with an update), I finally only got a refund when I threatened to take them to small claims court.  How, with a good conscience, do you sell items that you can't deliver to customers?  Also, the quality was shoddy.  To give them credit, they did replace one particularly poorly made item, but still---I expected better.  From a customer service perspective, though, steer clear at all costs.  You may never get what you've paid for.  As another user said, I wanted to like this company very much.  Yet I think that in my entire adult life, I've never been as poorly treated as I was by them.Of particular note, one of the main reasons why I purchased the product (besides the general ""green"" design) was the convertibility to a toddler crib.  After nine months, however, I have given up hope on getting them to ship me the conversion kit.  Which makes it all a huge sham, and defeats the whole point of my purchase.",1
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,I feel so much better using this. The other movement monitors only work in a crib- this works anywhere. The only thing I don't like is that it is hard to turn off-you have to push 2 buttons simultaneously- I guess so it doesn't turn off accidentally. I am glad I got this it should  be on everyone's registry.,5
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This product really does work, and it doesn't look ridiculous like some of the other locks available.  It has held up to a year of abuse from our toddler and is still going strong.  I just purchased a second door monkey to lock another door in the house.",5
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"I gave the previous edition a 5 star too.  However, it wound up with problems a few months later.  Specifically, the colors stopped working.This one looks like it fits the base better, and it seems more durable.  The light around the base is a nice improvement too.",5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"Would work great for things like lamps, clocks, etc that have thin cables.  But power bar cables are too thick to fit in these.  Bummer.",1
"NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear",I originally purchased the Nuk active cup to help wean my daughter off of the Nuk bottle when she was one. She took to the cup right away and never needed a bottle again. These replacement spouts are great because a year later ours need to be replaced. But you could also just purchase these replacement spouts and use the on the Nuk bottles and save $10 a cup.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I has been over 9 months since we have purchased this swing and I have honestly say that it has helped a LOT. For a few months it was the only place where our baby would nap and not wake up screaming... Even now, when she is almost up to the weight limit we still use it when she is tired and needs a minute to rest however we do not use motor anymore just because she is to heavy . No issues with the motor before, it does make a ""clicking"" noise but is has never bothered us, we put the music on on the lowest lever and it was all good. Strongly recommend for the parents whose babies have sleeping issues.",5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"very cute toy. It can run very far only by pulling back it on the ground as far as you want. The little balls inside of it are very cute. My son got it when he was 7 month old, and played with it for more than a month everyday. He just loves it.",5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Compagno Stroller, Nero","I was soo excited to get this stroller. I thought the price was great. I started putting it together, the front wheels went on with no problem, but the back wheels will NOT snap in like they are supposed to. I thought maybe Im just doing it wrong, so I had 3 other people help me and no one could get the wheels to snap on. So I called the manufacturer to see if maybe the axel was wrong, they sent a new one but of course that did not fix the problem, So needless to say, I will NEVER order another stroller on here again.",2
Boon Odd Duck - Squish,I wanted our daughter to have as many safe toys as possible. A PVC free toy is safer the a regular plastic one at the same price so I was sold. The baby enjoys playing at it and clutching it w/ both hands. Eventually we will use it in the bath. For now it's a safe toy w/o bells and whistles w/ no small parts that is safe for an infant. I love the bright color and am ordering Bob next!,5

Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,"I really like this nursing cover. It's cute, adjustable, has the peep device in the front. However, It makes me so hot. I don't know why. It seems like a think piece of fabric but every time I use it I get extremely hot...",4
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey",I bought one these for my wife to make it easier for the both of us with the middle of the night feeding. It was doing its job and then one night it turned off and never came back on. So I went out and bought another one (same product) and what do you know the same exact thing happened. I don't know if it is my bad luck i got two faulty kettles or what but this is really frustrating and wasting a lot of money on faulty products.,1
Professional Clinical Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead (Fahrenheit Readings),"Just bought this as we have a new baby on the way. Tested it out on myself tonight. Within 2 minutes the readings at the same place (right temple with hair out of the way as described in instructions at the same distance from forehead) were: 98.2, 98.6, 99.9, 101.7.  Really? Am I supposed to take the average?  I can't get it to say the same thing twice.An oral thermometer read 98.6.Very frustrated with this productI am a physician, but was buying this for home use.",2

"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I reviewed this product and other similar products for quite some time before deciding.  This car seat is easy to install.  I love the clips underneath the padding, which alleviates a lot of stress from using the old metal clip on certain types of seat belts.  This car seat had very high rating and I am completely satisfied with it.Great purchase",5

Baby Bamboo Feeding Spoons (Set of 2),"These were nice spoons and I appreciate that they are natural and chemical-free.  However, they do seem to wear down quickly over time with repeated washing, and I'd recommend discarding them once your baby starts chewing-- my 10 month old was able to bite off a small piece.",2
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Ballerina Layette Set with Gift Box, Pink",This was ordered as a shower gift.  I will be giving this gift in two weeks.  Hopefully they will be happy with the fit.,5
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This car seat is absolutely perfect for my 10 month old daughter!! We had to upgrade from the Chicco KeyFit 30 due to a car accident.  In order to leave the hospital, my husband and I had to go get a new car seat.  We went to the nearest babies 'r' us while my daughter was still admitted, and purchased a Safety First similar model, and loved the look of it.  However, when my daughter would fall asleep in it, her head would fall forward EVERY time, looking so uncomfortable, and that couldn't have been good for her developing neck!! So, I returned it and did my research on amazon and decided to spend the money on this seat.  I am so happy with the purchase! The print is beautiful, even more vibrant in person and is a soft, velour type material.  It is relatively easy to install, depending on whether you use the anchors and their position in your car.  Its not too heavy, and my daughter is so snuggled and comfortable in it, she falls asleep almost immediately making for a much happier car ride for my family!! I would definitely recommend this, and will purchase it for my future children.",5
"Evenflo Triumph 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Easton","I was t-boned at 35mph by some woman driving her minivan while texting.  Our mazda is totaled, my wife and I are bruised up, but my son is safe and sound.  He actually laughed after the crash and I promptly ordered the same seat to replace the old one.it's BIG, but it does its job.  Very easy to install and adjust, I love how you don't have to re-rout the straps to grow with your little one.",5
"Dr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 oz","Our twins spent 3 weeks in the NICU after they were born for several reasons.  After many of the severe issues cleared up for them, they still were not able to come home until they were able take full feeds by themselves (by bottle) every time.  The nurses used our dr. brown bottles we had bought.  I was told by several of the NICU nurses that Dr. Brown's were the best....so I was very glad that I had chosen those bottles for our babies.Fast forward two months and having the babies home now....these bottles LEAK!!  My husband and I have been soaked several times--and the problem is they are inconsistenly leaking--we COULD NOT figure out why they were leaking.  I had just opened another new package of these bigger bottles as we are starting to outgrow the 4 ounce ones, and I looked at the informational packet inside.  The print is SOOO small--like a size 4 font, seriously!  Anyway, I read through it trying to determine if there was something I was doing wrong, and sure enough, the last part says that the blue insert needs to have the hole vent up and not covered in formula.  SO, we put it to the test.  and YES, no more leaks.  So we line up the brown insert holes with the ""DR. BROWN"" words on the bottle and make sure the blue tube end is up when we put together the bottle so when the ""Dr. Brown"" words are facing up, the bottle wont leak. Works like a charm.  Hope this makes sense. I am sleep deprived and exhausted but had to leave this message for any other weary mom who is just about to give up.  My husband was about to spend over $125 on new bottles so I'm very glad I found this out.  HOpe this helps someone too.",4
DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag - Red Retro Stripe,"Pros: lots of pockets, hooks on to stroller easily, good distribution of items in the bag.Cons: zippers feel like they won't last long, they stick a little and I just got it. I use cloth diapers and would love for the hammock to be a little bigger to accommodate 5 cloth diapers. I can only fit 4 all in ones.",4
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"I have used a few brands and so far these are the best compared to pampers sensitive.They are sturdy and seem to wipe away more per swipe than the pampers, which seem to just move ""stuff"" around.They don't have any odor, and I like that they are chlorine free.They seem to be a little more expensive than other brands, however, you can use fewer wipes because they are so good.",5
"The Gro Company Grosuit Fluffy Clouds (White, 3 - 6 Months ) [Baby Product]",Bought the suit to go with my grobag and its very comfortable and my baby is not overheating. We have the air condition on which goes down to almost 16 degrees Celsius and my baby is happy and cozy with just the suit (no undergarment needed per gro company's website) and grobag 2.5 TOG. Plus it comes with 2 suits so I have extra handy for those wet nights,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","I bought this for my baby to keep his food warm. Before this item, i was using my friend's Zojirushi. I was pleased when i received the product and so i proceeded to wash it the first time. To my dismay, the lid could not be dismantled, which would have been possible with the zojirushi. I emailed thermos and they confirmed only the gasket could be removed. The gap between the lid and the gasket is too narrow for a sponge to reach and give it a good scrub. As this item is for my baby and hygiene is compromised, i cannot bring myself to give any additional stars.",1
"Ikea 36 Pcs Kalas Kids Plastic BPA Free Flatware, Bowl, Plate, Tumbler Set, Colorful","My kids love these. They love that I let them use knives (they're 2 and 4)! Forks and spoons are probably a bit too large/long for my 2-yr-old but he MUST do whatever his older bro does, so of course he uses them anyway. We've used these (approximately) a million times since purchase 8 mos ago and still love the whole set. All the colors are fun!",5

green sprouts Silicone Baby Toothbrush,Wish I'd seen this sooner!  My son is one now but I wish I'd had this all along.  I love that it's built like a normal toothbrush so there's no transition really when he's ready for a true brush.  The round plate keeps him from shoving down his throat.  Great all around!,5
Kids Line Organic Willow Throw Pillow,"The pillows are small, and aren't very full, but they are absolutely adorable, and complete the look of the set.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I got the medium wet bag and it is small enough to toss in my diaper bag, but also holds about a days worth of dirty diapers when filled all the way up (about 12 diapers and a couple covers). I like using the wet bag because when it's time to wash diapers, I just toss the diapers in and the wet bag.I would suggest line drying the wet bag to protect and prolong the life of the PUL. If you are going to dry in the dryer, make sure to put the PUL back inside the bag (it usually comes out in the wash) and zipper shut so it doesn't get burned or messed up in the dryer.The bag itself is really cute, high quality and well made.",4

Fisher Price Fisher Price Fastfinder Deluxe Messenger Bag,We haven't actually used this yet since the baby hasn't arrived but it seems perfect. I wanted a diaper bag that my husband wouldn't be embarrassed carrying around and this is it. It matches everything and has many convenient pockets.

Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics: Snap-Lock Beads - Vehicle Shapes,These are awesome and very good for my special needs child.  He can put them together and pull them apart - great motor skill toy.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that you should be aware that one set doesn't go a long way.  We have three sets and that is enough to make a couple of necklaces.,4
Philips AVENT Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,my wife & i spent a lot of time researching different baby monitors & are extremely happy w/ this one.  very clear sound & easy to use.  both my wife & i are deep sleepers so if the sound doesnt wake us up the flashing lights do.  unit has good range as we found ourselves working outside on more than one occasion while she slept.,5

She would not sleep without them....BUT one day she got it stuck in her mouth! I didnt even know a babies mouth could fit that...so I guess these are ok as long as your baby isnt like mine.,3
"Sunshine Kids Dry Seat Pad, Grey","I recieved a Sunshine Kids Juvenile Products Dry Seat Waterproof Seat pad to review and I've got to say I'm somewhat impressed! Though a word of caution for use in carseats. You should NEVER use any aftermarket products not designated for use by your specific carseat manufacturer. We do own and use a Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL carseat and we'll be trying this out this as an add-on to this seat. Especially when we start potty training our youngest.I don't however se it fitting in the seat very well with the toddler body suppot pillow in place. I tried it out in our oldest sons old Evenflo Generations 65 and it seemed to fit alright. One drawback I can see for use in ANY carseat is that it may cause difficulty in getting proper harness fit. It may be better for use in a belt-positioning booster vs. a 5pt harness seat.To test the ""waterproof"" claim I decided to open my rockin' Klean Kanteen and dump a good amount of water in soaking the pad quite a bit. It did infact contain the water within the seat cover keeping the underside dry.The only drawback I can see would be if somehow water and or any other liquid was spilled directly over the buckle the seat underneath would get wet. Though not really a design flaw or anything that can be done differently either. There is a nice little guard area that should help minimize that where the buckle comes through the dry seat pad. I soaked the pad about an hour and a half ago and it's still fairly wet, I'm not sure how long it will take to air dry completely. Overall I like this product, but I'm not in love with it. I would recommend this for someone who is looking for something to keep their stroller seats dry or for a belt positioning (Sunshine Kids only!) booster, not for use in a carseat that uses a harness system.",4
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I originally purchased these bags on a trial basis.  I wanted a diaper Genie, but heard that they don't really cover up the smell and were difficult to use.  The bags have a light baby powder scent that really helps with those stinky diapers.  BUT...when you have so many, the smell will eventually come through.  Therefore, you need to empty the garbage on a regular.  I love the small size.  They fit into a zipper compartment in my diaper bag and come in so handy when I'm out and about.  Because of the powder smell, I don't feel bad when throwing them away at a friends house.  So far, one box of 200 is lasting for a while.  My son is 3 months old and I still have plenty left.  I plan to buy more when necessary.  You can't beat the great price!!!",5
"JJ Cole Travel Pod Set, Cocoa Tree","I was originally looking for just a pacifier pod, this was listed in the also bought. I don't use the the bottle cooler since I use powder formula on the go. The pod keeps my spare pacifier clean, and the diaper tote is great for those quick trips when you don't want to take a full size (and heavy) diaper bag. I am able to get about four Size 2 diapers, the changing pad (included), a travel container of wipes (Huggies), and there is a handy outside pocket that I keep a travel pack of disinfecting wipes in. They all have snap handles that I have found useful. All are easy clean, the pod, tote, and changing pad can all be tossed into the wash. The bottle cooler is just a quick wipe down. I love this item and would gladly purchase it again!",5

Sassy Sensation Station Suction Toy,"A friend of ours gave us a suction cup toy for my son who just turned three months old.  After attaching it to his high chair and seeing how excited he was to play with something while sitting up, I went to find some similar toys.  I found this one at Target and figured I'd give it a try even though it said 6+ months on it.  He LOVES it.  It spins and plays sounds and music with every bat of the hand, it has really started to improve his ability to grasp objects as well.  The suction cup works very well on both the high chair tray and the small tray that attaches to his swing.  I'm looking forward to buying him several of these types of toys so we can rotate them and keep him entertained.",5

Graco Baby SnugGlider Infant Car Seat Swing Frame,"I bought this swing as a way to save space and have something portable, and this does both!  For the first month, we used this almost every night.  The motor is on the noisier side, but it actually seemed to be soothing for my daughter.  The clicking is like a metronome (or like an odd heartbeat, if you want to think of it that way - rhythmic).  As she got a bit older, we didn't use it at night but she still enjoyed some time in it, and if she wouldn't fall asleep any other way, this worked.  I was able to store it under the bed and get it out when we needed it.  Now it lives by the back door, and when she's asleep from the car ride, I can click her in and she stays asleep.  I don't use the powered swinging as much anymore, but when the seat is in the swing and my daughter stirs, it rocks a bit and helps soothe her back to sleep.  It does take some practice to get the seat in the swing smoothly, though.  I can't say much for the music and vibration; I don't use them.The motor did fail at some point, but I contacted Graco and they quickly sent a replacement, no hassle.A couple tips for the swing:1. Once you turn it on, give it a push to get it going.  It's much easier for the motor to synchronize with it already swinging than it is to start from a standstill.  I've read some reviews that say the swing doesn't move on low and moves too fast on high, and I think this helps.  It's worked well on all the levels for me.  When my daughter was newborn, we had it just barely on, and it had a nice, gentle, rock.  I have had to turn the motor up a little bit to compensate for her growth, but I think that's to be expected; I still don't turn it all the way up (she's 11 months and above average size for her age).2. Put the handlebar back.  It definitely throws the balance off a bit when it's up and I've found it to be much smoother when I've put it back.  Really the only times I've had the swinging action stop on me while the motor was still running is when I had the handlebar up.I think I figured out both of these after killing that first motor; I've had no problems with the new one.",4
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","I can't understand how this is supposed to keep my baby warm in the NY winter. No way. I can't imagine how freezing It would get for those in colder areas and this just won't make the cut, I'm sure.Sooo simple solution. Get the Bundle Me and simply cut the parts that obstruct and sit behind your baby. Then sew the edges so the filler doesn't come out. Set it up on the seat without obstructing the straps. DONE! Warm baby and very safe.",1
Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Medium,"Still on the hunt for the perfect hands free bra/tank. Pretty sure it doesn't exist but this comes the closest. When the bottle is getting full , it tends to lose suction and then you have to hold it anyway. The tank is very thick, which is both nice and cumbersome, when wearing under clothes. However, the company is wonderful! Offered me a coupon for ordering again, but I just don't need it. I would order true to size, I ordered it too big as well. If anything go smaller.",3
Sunshine Kids Cool It 2 Cooler,"great price if it worked. great size however zipper is broken, therefore items cant stay cooled.Therefore doesn't do the job.",2
Britax Car Seat Storage Pouch,Great place to store extra things needed. Plenty of room quality well made. Glad we have this for our seat. Happy with it,5
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large","this is great for me. iordered a small (i am 5'5 and 125 lbs) and as soon as i figured out the trick to getting my son into a good position he will now fall asleep in this as soon as he is in. the only downfall i would say is according to the website and sizing  the smal should fit my husband who is 6'2 and 180 lbs. its too small for him. i had toorder him a seperate one  (baby k'tan breeze, ) in the medium. that seems to be slightly  big as my son is only 6 weeks old but it fits my husband much better than the small.",4
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"We used the snap-n-go when they first came out...liked it then.  Now with our third child we rec'd the newer version.  We have an Eddie Bauer carrier.  The booklet that comes with it shows the carrier and gives instructions on placement.  The problem is that the Eddie Bauer carrier is only held in place by a strap - it DOES NOT LOCK INTO PLACE, like all of the other carriers would.  Now, it may seem that why not use just the strap - well, the strap is the SECOND saftey mechanism for the seat...and really should not be used as the only one b/c when you move the stroller the seat moves around....the latch is for a reason, and if you cannot securely latch the carrier - they should NEVER instruct you to be able to use it - just to make the $$.  We're returning it!  Sorry but our child's safety should be their concern...too!",1
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"I am extremely happy with this pump. I am a working mom with a 5 month old at home and am determined to breastfeed my baby for a year. I have a very busy schedule and my work requires me to travel. With this pump I dont have to worry about all that. I can use it easy and quick. I use the double pump and hands free feature. It works great. I would recommend it to any working mom. The price is a little high, but it is worth every cent.",5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,"First of all, this jumper is pretty stylish - it's not an eyesore. All of the toys are detachable so even once your baby is too big for the bouncer you can take the plush monkey off, you can take the 3 play stations off, and they can play with them. It has 3 different levels; my baby is on the highest one right now (level 3) and he is in 18 month clothes, just to give you an idea of his height in regards to the jumper. The cloth seat can easily be taken out and washed and dried by the machine which is convenient with a messy baby. There are two things I don't really like about this jumper. The knobs to adjust the height of the chair are extremely hard to turn - I had to put gloves on in order to turn them. And the obvious - it's pretty huge, it takes up a lot of space. It's all worth it though because he loves playing in it!",4
Tooth Fairy Box,These are so cute. The only thing I don't like is one of the lids fits snug and one is loose. We tried both lids on both boxes because we bought two. Very cute way to store the kids baby teeth.,4
Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat Extra Base,New base - works like the old base...This is an identical item to the original as shipped with the B-Safe car seat.,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","My son loves this teether! I call it his ""razzle dazzle berry"" and he gets so excited when it's in front of him. Although, I'm not positive, I think that it has actually weaned him from his regular binky. He loves to chew on all of them now and isn't interested in sucking them. I know a lot of parents want to wean their kids of the binky, but I wasn't ready for that since he needs to suck to sleep. Like I said, I can't say it was this teether, but it did happen shortly after he started chewing it.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I bought this stroller for my 2 1/2 year old twin boys who have outgrown their Graco DuoGlider. My son who sat on the back jump seat looked somewhat comfortable but there is no back/head rest. My son who sat in the front seat was very uncomfortable! His feet kept touching the wheels and the seat is VERY shallow! I would only recommend this stroller for short rides and the front seat only for infants.,2
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate. A recommended extension needed to be purchased. The wrong extension was sent. I needed G24 model and received 24"""" extension for a different model.",1
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",I purchased the playpen for my teacup puppy an it is perfect for him.  Very attractive and sturdy.  It is easy to set up.  I can easily pick up the end and roll it to wherever I wish to have it.  If I had purchased it for a child I would like to see a bit more padding on the top rails.  For what I need it is great.,5
"Gro Baby  Shell Set, Vanilla","I have several of these and have 3 inserts for each shell.What I love about this diaper:1. Pretty! There are lots of bright, attractive colors and patterns. We have ""boy"" and ""girl"" patterns. I love them all!2. Non-irritating velcro. The tabs are not scratchy and won't irritate baby's skin. They're almost smooth to the touch!3. Perfect laundry tabs. They fold right over on themselves!4. Overlapping tabs. If you have a skinny baby, the tabs will fasten on top of each other for a snug fit.5. Elastic in the liner. There is elastic around the legs to help hug the liner to your baby.6. Snap-in liners. No more bunching up! These liners snap right in to the shell.7. Slim in the middle. Cloth diapers are bulkier than disposables. Period. When our baby wears these, I can tell by the way she is walking. They are slimmer than the other AIO (all in one)'s we have tried and I really like that!What I would change:1. We have LOTS of ""leakage"" from the liner to the shell. The elastic helps, but if the baby poops, chances are we are going to have to rinse and change the shell. We don't often make it through a day without going through at least 4 shells. With other AIO systems, we can make it through a day with 2 shells.2. Taller rise. Our baby is short and chunky. At 15 months old, she is totally unsnapped, so the rise will not go any higher for her. She may outgrow these before any of our other cloth diapers. These were the first we had to go up in size every time she grew, also.3. Wing droop. With the velcro closures, there is nothing to hold the wings up - the part that is tucker under and around your baby's belly. With the snaps, this is addressed, but the velcro leaves some hanging wings on skinny babies. Our chunky baby doesn't have much of an issue with it, but it could be troublesome if your baby isn't full-figured. :-)Overall, I really like these. Very functional, but you might need a few shells more than other AIO systems. :-)",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","When I opened this product I noticed that the chair was clean and didn't seem to have any rips and is overall in great shape.However, the right arm seam was spread open about a centimeter wide by about 7 inches down the side. This was quickly fixed with a hammer, but is the only reason I didn't give this chair a 5 out of 5. This tear at the seem could have been from shipping so it might not come this way to everyone?My son is 10 months old and tall for his age, he has a lot of room to grow in this chair and can use it comfortably now. The only thing I recommend is removing the glider pieces on the bottom (two screws) if your child isn't old enough to sit still, as it would definitely topple over if a toddler crawled up the back of the chair. I plan to put these pieces back on once he is older.",4
"Kushies Waterproof Bib, Blue Circle, Infant","I have been through quite a few bibs, and each had its pros and cons.  These are perfect.  They are lightweight, so my son doesn't get hot and fussy wearing it.  The pocket sticks out far enough to actually be useful, just without being made of hard uncomfortable rubber like the Bjorn.  The prints are cute but still neutral.  They are waterproof and machine washable.  I leave one in my diaper bag and just wipe it down at the restaurant before storing it.  That way I always have a clean bib in the bag, without all the fuss of remembering to replace it.",5
"My Pool Pal Reusable Swim Diaper, Pink, 2T","Our potty-trained kiddo is required to wear a swim diaper in lessons, and the fit of the iPlay brand was just not working. I was thrilled to find My Pool Pal as an alternative. The cut is similar to a traditional swimsuit, and fits FAR better onto our preschooler's frame. For reference, kiddo wears 100 or 110 at Hanna, and a 4T or 5T in most brands.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink",My 3 month old will play on this for 30 minutes or more at a time. She loves to look at herself in the mirror and kick the piano to make the music. I love that it can grow with the child and isn't just for infants. The piano can detach for an older child to carry around which is a great feature.,5
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"I bought this tub after my baby outgrew her infant tub. It worked well and I always felt safe with the big inflated sides keeping her safe. The only drawback is that it popped after about 6 months. That was 6 months of daily use so I suppose it held up well for being an inflatable item. However, I am going to go with a standard plastic tub going forward so I don't have to worry about buying a new tub every 6 months.",3
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","I bought a B540 and a B530 at the same time for our son, one each for my and my wife's cars.  At first I was thrilled!  They are light, apparently very well made, and get a fantastic NHTSA rating.  One drive, however, pointed out a major design flaw: tipping.Our son is a few months shy of his 4th birthday, weighs about 40 pounds, and stands about 38"" tall.  He is very quiet in his car seat and doesn't squirm around at all.  He loves being able to (at the appropriate time) undo his own latch and get out of the car himself.  The arm rests and cup holders are also big hits with him.What he doesn't like and what scares the (bad word) out of us is even moderate cornering speeds cause the chair to tip over.  Since this system uses only the shoulder and lap belts to hold both child and chair in place, anytime the vehicle moves with less force than trips the seatbelt tensioner or locking mechanism both child and chair are free to slide around to the extent a freely moving seatbelt allows.  That turns out to be quite a lot.Yesterday was a perfect example.  When leaving daycare I made a concerted effort to take up as much seatbelt slack as possible as an experiment to see if I could prevent the tipping.  Maybe one minute later I left a stoplight making a left-hand turn.  By the turn's exit my son was at a 45 degree angle to the right and kind of freaking out about it.  The turn had been nowhere near enough to cause the seatbelt to lock yet the centrifugal force almost completely tipped him and the seat on their sides.  I keep wondering what would happen if I swerved to avoid an obstacle and then had to slam on the brakes.  The rapid turn would almost certainly dump the chair over, causing the restraints to be BADLY misaligned during a panic stop.  Who knows what would happen if that was followed by a collision.I have resorted to placing the seat in an outboard position behind the driver's chair.  This allows it to sit in the depression formed by the contouring of the car's seats.  Placing the booster chair in the middle position, the safest place in an accident, puts it on a slight hump and makes this problem so bad as to be literally unusable.  It is tipping on virtually every corner, enough to cause my son's eyes to widen.I called Learning Curve and the rep said she had not heard of such a problem.  After checking with an engineer I was told I probably had the seatbelt misaligned or the seat installed incorrectly, neither of which is true (the seats are VERY easy to install).  The only option she suggested was moving up to either their model B570 or B830, both of which are significantly more expensive but feature mounting hardware.I cannot fathom why these seats are not either anchored or designed with a wider base to prevent tipping.  The anchor points would not need to be terribly robust as restraint during an accident would still be handled by the belt.  I had briefly thought about running a bungee cord between the rear LATCH points, passing it through the fold where the lower seat meets the backrest, but my concerns about safety being untested with that configuration were echoed by the Learning Curve rep.I drive and Acura RDX, my wife has a Ford Focus.  I have leather seats, she has cloth.  Our vehicles interior designs are completely different yet we both experience the same issue.  As it stands I cannot and would not recommend these seats to anyone until the issue of tipping during moderate lateral acceleration has been addressed.  Both seats will be returned to Amazon; I have not yet decided what their replacements will be.",1
"DaVinci Thompson 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",Just bought this crib from Amazon.Was delivered super fast (may be because we are in California).Good:1.)

DwellStudio Baby Transportation Hooded Towel,"I bought this for my 8 month old since he out grew the infant ones.  We LOVE this.  It is soft, well made and a decent size.  We will be able to use it for quite some time.  The pattern is adorable too!",5
OsoCozy Unbleached Organic Flannel Baby Wipes 12 pack,"We love these and use them with the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer. We were so busy with our newborn that we actually just wet these, wrung them out, and then just scrunched them up and threw them in the warmer (no time to fold them!), which has worked great for the last couple months. One wipe goes a long way with newborn poop. We usually only need to use one for each diaper change. They wash easily and well - we haven't had any staining. We purchased 24 and this seems to be enough given that we're doing laundry ever 2-3 days. You might want more depending on your laundry habits.",5
Kid-ding Waterproof Multi-Use Pads - 18&quot; x 27&quot; - 4 Pack,Very useful item. We use them to protect the bassinet mattress as well as on top of the changing pad and under the changing pad cover. We have also used them when giving our newborn a sponge bath. The pads are absorbent and can be washed in the washing machine. The size is good.,5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"In my opinion this is the best tub for babies. It fit perfect on my kitchen sink, which made bath time highly convenient.  It is also the perfect size.  And the foam mat that is inside it made it so baby does not slide around. It is also reclined perfectly to keep baby in the perfect position. I got this for a shower gift for my first baby.  Then I got another tub for my second child 2 yrs later.  I ended up putting away the new one and sending my husband to the storage unit to get this one back out.  I love this tub and would reccommend it to anyone.  The only problem that I would have with it is the foam does not come out so it could harbor bacteria. I just always made sure to rinse it with antibacterial soap and HOT water after every use. No other tub compares!!",5

"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black","I bought this so that I can take my 6 month old on hikes with me, and it says that it was meant for front or rear facing positions.  In rear position, it is very unsafe for baby, and there is no safe way to put it on or take it off either.  My baby fell out of the carrier while attempting to take it off, an I have not used it since, it's garbage.  Luckily she was not hurt.",1

Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"The brown triangle is a fuzz that is easy for our son to pull out with his teeth. He has always liked biting fuzzy things and trying to pull the fuzz out.

"Diono Monterey Booster Seat, Blue","I have only bought Britax carseats for my children until I discovered the Diono Monterey Booster. I was looking for a seat that has LATCH tethers, great safety ratings by the Institute for Highway Safety, and is stylish. The Monterey boasted all of these qualities AND garnered rave reviews from parents. I am so glad I made the switch from Britax because my kids and I love these seats. They fit nicely on the back seats of my Audi Q5 and are very comfortable. I received seats with a manufacture date of March 2013 so I have not experienced any issues with the seatbelt threading through the headrest that some posters have complained about with older versions of this seat. It works perfectly!",5
"Sesame Street Potty and Step Stool Combo Set, Framed Friends","My grandchild love the Sesame street theme.  The stool is very nice and she carries it everywhere,  The potty handles on the potty seat, as most padded seats, are not high enough to craddle the child and it slides around when the child moves.  I will not use this potty seat for training, but I kept it to use for when the child is older and can sit without squirming. DN",3
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I was prepping bottles and put 5 liners into 5 bottles and one right after the other all 5 started leaking. Those were the only 5 but with how expensive they are I shouldn't have that issue. It also was extreemly frustrating having 5 in a row and milk spilling everywhere. I have since decided to switch bottles, because of the cost and the frustration. I used these with my oldest but I just don't want to deal with buying liners all the time for another 6+ months.",2

"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",We got this for my son when we needed to switch my daughter from the infant seat to a convertible.  my son is 4 and very tall for his age.  He loves this seat.  We've taken it several times on planes and are very happy with it.  We like the low profile (my daughter can't kick the seat in front of her on the plane when she's in it) but it is heavy.  I can see some kids having a problem being able to see out the car window if they aren't as tall as my son (42&#34;).  After buying the first one and liking it we bought one for my car too.  I like that we can use it as a booster when he's older but we'll keep him in the 5 point harness as long as we can.,5
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,Love this item! My car stays clean and I don't have to worry about stains on my seat. I use it with my grace myride 65 and it is still big enough to collect the things my son drops. It's perfect!!!,5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Back when he was just a teensy sprout, my now 13-year-old developed a fascination for these sippy cups. Didn't have to be a specific color, but it had to be THIS CUP. Personally, I love them because a bottle brush gets in there to clean the corners and the valves aren't complicated mechanisms that leave you knowing *knowing* that there's goo in there somewhere you will never get to. Ugh. These valves are just a little rubber x, yet still highly effective. the tops are solid enough to take repeated gnawing without failing, and the entire thing will survive being tossed out of windows and off of playground equipment. Believe me, I know this.See, my son became so attached, he named this cup continuum. I have no idea why, but the kid would introduce himself to new people, then introduce his cup as &#34;Dieter&#34; (pronounced &#34;Deeeter&#34;. Apparently, these cups are German?) All I know is that the kid went on adventures with his trusty sidekick-- a plucky cup who was bad at following instructions, but had a good heart. A heart filled with water, milk or very occasionally half-filled with juice. Dieter and my kid finally parted ways one day at Legoland when the last known Dieter in the house went overboard on the lake, and the crew couldn't reach it with the net-pole-hybrid fishy thing. We spent the next few years following his progress around the world's waterways on the world map. Here's to you, little buddy.Since that time, though, I've managed to spawn one more offspring-- this one is fresh and shiny and eleven months old as of this writing. She now has a set of Dieters ready to adventure-- we wondered, will she like them? Will she use them? Will my kids share the same taste in plastic cup buddies even if they were born so far apart?Yep. She's taken to them swimmingly and was last seen stealing away her dessert of a couple of ounces of orange juice to figure out how to return to scaling the furniture with Dieter in hand. No new name yet though. I'll keep you posted.",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,"I wanted to love this product.  I really did -- cheaper to purchase than the Go Go Babyz Travelmate, which was why I selected it for my recent trip, and very light and maneuverable.  The product was very easy to use -- we attached it to my Diono Radian carseat and strapped my 17-pound 9-month old in, and it did great throughout the airport and stowed quickly and easily on the airplane.Unfortunately, on the return trip a plastic piece inside the transporter must have broken, because one of the wheels collapsed inward when I was getting off of the airport train and my daughter almost took a header into the ground were it not for some kind people behind us.  We managed to get the wheel straight so that I could get her off the train, but it was broken, and when we got home my husband did some further investigation and determined that the broken piece was not replaceable.So while I want to recommend this, I just cannot because it didn't even get me back home at the end of the trip.  :(Edit:  Contacted Brica and they stood by their product.  Shipped me a brand new one.  So I edited my stars to reflect that I did not lose any money on this product.  Still minus one for breaking when I needed it the most, but hopefully they are working on this because otherwise it's a great product.",4
Delta Children's Products Lil' Drive Baby Activity Walker,"This is the cutest activity walker ever.  I did my research and this was the best option for safety (prevents child from falling down steps) and for chubby thighs.  My son is 7 months old and he would spend all day in this walker if he could.  He loves to horn and play with the gadgets designed to help develop fine motor skills. He is afraid of the roaring engine sounds so I keep the volume turned to off.  My husband does not like the wheels at all.  We have hardwood flooring and the wheels do leave scraches.  He tried replacing the wheels, but couldn't find any rubber ones to fit.  As a compromise, we confine the little one to the kitchen.  I highly recommend this product!",4
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I mostly use the Gerber plastic covers you can get at the store, and they are fine.

"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I've had a couple of the older models - the minor improvements such as the larger cup holder area are actually really nice.  Getting the latch system out for the first time is a bit of a chore, but not a huge deal.  This seat, unlike the older model, only has one strap for the latch system - the previous one had two short straps on each side.  I'm still not sure how I feel about it - I do think the latch is a bit harder to get tightened up in this one.  Stil, a good seat.  Its *heavy* though - a bit cumbersome if you want to move it between cars often.",5

ZoLi BOT XL Straw Sippy Cup (Green) - 9 oz.,"We ended up giving the three Zoli Bot cups we bought away.  This cup is a mini volcano with milk constantly rising to the straw top and spilling over, creating pools of milk around it.  You can only loosen the lid to relieve the pressure so many times per day before calling it quits.  We went back to the Munchkin straw cup.  It leaks if the kiddo throws it on the ground, but that's preferable to than the cup that leaks on its own.",1
"Disney Sophia 4 Piece The First Toddler Set, Sweet As A Princess",My 3 yr old loved it when she opened it for Christmas.  We got a great Lightning Deal on it and it's great.  Is it high thread count - no but unless you're royalty or something...a 3 yr old is not going to know the difference.  Besides - it's more about the looks than anything and that is why we bought it.,5

I am really satisfied with the shipping time it took to come to my house but the quality of the bag isn't that great.

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"The infant optics baby monitor isn't a top end model, but for the money it is a great buy.- it has very good video quality without any lag- the automute function removes the static noise - great to use if you are a light sleeper- the night vision is excellent- very light handheld unit if you plan to move this around at home- the options and menu are very straight forward to any anti-hightech users- it comes with a plastic mount for the camera to point downwards.... and it works well if you put the camera on an elevated furnitureThe only complain I want to say is the battery doesn't last very long. I would recommend getting another power cord if you plan to use this other than your bedroom.",5

CJs BUTTer Tube o BUTTer Plus,"I originally got this to use as diaper cream with our cloth diapers.  It works great and clears up rashes that other cloth diaper safe creams just couldn't get rid of.  Once I saw how great it worked for the diaper rash I started using it on other things such as cuts and dry skin.  It's amazing, I'd been trying to get rid of bumpy dry skin on my son for months and if I put this on each night and morning it clears right up.  I even use it on my own face at night now.  I've had acne for years and I guess it was because of dry skin because after a week of using this it's so much clearer.This has been added to my standard list of things to get new moms at baby showers because I think everyone needs to have it in their back pocket.",5
The Ultimate Baby Wrap in Navy,"Come on, MOMS! This wrap is softer, more flexible, more comfortable and logical than ANY OTHER wrap available (at least in the U.S. market). My wife and I have tried two well-advertised others, and could never get them ""to work"". We were delighted to discover this one. Yes, it circles you a few times, and yes, it takes a bit of practice to feel safe, and move child around inside, and take them out if they fell asleep, but - again - there is no better, more cuddly, smart design out there. Forget Baby Bjorn and other carriers: those are COMPLETELY different, in their design, intent and functionality. Yes, Bjorn is better than the Disney crap and many others brands, but comparing a wrap to a carrier shows lack of carrier understanding and ignorance of a wrap's history. Trust a heavyset, easily sweating father (and my scientist wife agreed): this is the only and the best to get! Enjoy.",5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"I didn't think I needed a mirror for my car but after stressing with a fussing baby I couldn't see while driving I quickly changed my mind! This mirror works great! I have a newer Toyota Camry and it fits around the backseat headrest great. The mirror is a little stiff so it takes a moment to get it to swivel into place but that is good, on bumps it doesn't loose it's adjustment. The size is great too, just right.",5
"The First Years True Choice A100 Digital Monitor, One Parent Unit","I was a bit on the fence about purchasing this product because of all the more expensive alternatives. I of course wanted to make sure it would work well. However; after receiving this product I was more than pleased to see how petite and sleek the item is, It's hard to even tell that it's a monitor; and it works perfect, simple and effective!",5
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"It comes fully assembled and it's so easy to change the shape of the panels-which are huge when stretched out, it's sturdy and 85 pound lab proof!

Munchkin Gone Fishin' Bath Toy,"My daughter is 18 months old and quite familiar with the concept of fishing. She watches her dad fish almost daily, as we live on a lake. She was excited about this toy, but the magnetic functioning that enables the lure to &#34;hook&#34; the fish is so weak, if they do connect, it's only briefly. This causes unnecessary frustration and disappointment. I would not recommend this toy.",1

"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","I am a grandma and do a lot of babysitting.  I need to get three carseats in the back of a PT Cruiser (I know, good luck!) since another grandchild is on the way.  I ordered a Radian, knowing that I would hate it.  It is heavy, doesn't stand up by itself, and the buckle is difficult to undo.  However, I went into it knowing these facts, and have no choice.  When I received the car seat, the bottom LATCH is broken.  It is stuck in the closed position and won't open to &#34;grab&#34; the latchbar.  I didn't know whether to let Amazon know, or if Diono was the place to contact.  So I tried Diono first since it is their product.  I had to leave voice mails for customer service so I left 2 of them.  One had my cell # and then about 4 hours later, I left my home #.  No calls in 4 days.  I sent two emails, the first asking 2 questions about usage (before I tried it in the car and discovered the LATCH problem), then the second describing the problem.  3 days later, no answer again.  I have tried customer service again and the only option so far is to leave a message.  I then called Amazon and within about 3 minutes, I had a return shipping label in my email and another seat on the way.  I called Monday and my new seat is being delivered tomorrow (Wednesday).  Great service Amazon!  If you have a problem with your Radian, if my experience is any indication, don't expect ANYTHING from Diono, not even a call back to discuss the problem!!  If I could give them a &#34;0&#34; rating, I would.",1
"Boba Air Baby Carrier, Black","I purchased this Boba Air last month and wore it traveling over the holidays. For anyone thinking of buying one...it stinks. The straps are not comfortable as they have zero padding so they pull and cut into your shoulders. It also gaps a lot on the sides so it's awkward to nurse without draping a blanket over the gaping hole. I bought this because I wanted something lighter than the Ergo as it was too large for my frame. For now, I am going back to my Moby as it's still the most comfortable one I have worn so far. The material doesn't breathe as it's a nylon wind-breaker type material so it gets very hot.",1
"Britax B-Nimble Stroller, Red",I was very pleased with the stroller and the ease of its use. The cup holder doesn't stay on very well.,4
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I really like this stroller!  It isn't horribly heavy, but it does have some weight.  I chose orange so I could use it on trails during hunting season.  It folds pretty small and the wheels come off easily to make it smaller.  It comes assembled, except you have to pop on the wheels.  I would not use this on two-tracks or really uneven terrain because with 3 wheels, it could tip easily.  It has a 5 point harness system, which is nice.  I just clip toys and a pacifier on it.  Once you are comfortable with the stroller, you can pop it open with one hand!  I use this as an every day stroller.  I even use it for shopping - I just put my items in the basker under it.  You can't put a ton of stuff there, but $50 worth of groceries will fit.  This stroller turns on a dime, but you need to have the room to turn around since it is pretty long.  I also have the adapter for the Graco Snugride 35 carseat, the cupholder, and the weather shield.  I think those items are overpriced, but I like them all.  I would buy this again.",5

Boppy Maternity Support Band - Medium/Large,"I purchased this when I was about 6 mos pregnant and found it to be very helpful when I go on walks with the dog. Previously I felt a kind of uncomfortable weight or pressure in my lower abdomen, and had to walk slower than normal. This belly band provides support, holds my belly tight and keeps me from feeling jiggly. It was a little tricky to put on the 1st 1 or 2 times but got the hang of it. It doesn't stick to my clothes or scratch my skin. I bought small/medium. Prior to pregnancy I was approx a size 6 -8 in pants size and I've by 6 mos I had gained ~15#.",5
"Aurora Baby Blessings Plush, Lamb",I used this a part of a decoration on a Diaper Cake for a shower I hosted. The lamb is sweet and the ribbon is such a sweet touch,5
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","After much thought and countless hours of research to find the best maternity pillow for my wife I settled on this one. We were very satisfied with Boppy's nursing pillow with our first child that I assumed the quality would be the same with this product. Was I mistaken! As soon as we took it out of the package and opened it up, it looked so limp and flat from the start. It offered no support at all! I was considering keeping it and filling it myself, but I realized for the price, I shouldn't have to do that. Even cheap pillows would have more filling. Do not believe what you see in the picture. I thought that it would be as supportive as their best-selling pillow. I gave it two stars rather than one only because I liked the shape and design of this pillow and the fact that it came with a pillow case. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am with Boppy. I normally read and don't write any reviews, however, I was so unhappy with this product I needed to let the public know. Please reconsider if you were expecting a quality product.",2
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","We use them in our all in ones, but they wad up pretty quick and only catch a portion of the the poo. Almost not worth the time to throw it in there. Not to mention they are only half the price of a disposable diaper per sheet (using subscribe and save)",3
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,"After beginning cloth diapering, I discovered we have extremely hard water, as evidenced by the strong ammonia smell coming from our diapers about 4 weeks or so.  I was using Allen's at the time and would have to strip with Calgon.  After switching to this product, I no longer have to strip monthly.  More like every 3 or 4 months.  This detergent is a little more costly than some other brands, but worth it to me in time and water saved.",5
"Graco LiteRider Classic Connect Stroller, Pasadena",I bought this couple of months ego. It is very nice and my son loves it so much. Best value for the better price.,5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"The slow flow were just way to slow for my son at this point so we moved to the medium flow.  (he would take 35 - 45 minutes to feed 6 oz).  The packaging suggests babies 3 - 6 month babies should be able to handle this flow.  My son was a week shy of 3 months when we switched from the slow to the medium flow.  It took him a good 2 weeks to get use to it, he would spill a lot of formula out of his mouth, and spit up a lot more but now he is a pro.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","I read many of the reviews which said that this sleep sack was big, so I ordered the smaller (large) size for my 18m old. It was ridiculously big and there is no way my son could safely wear it. He is very tall for his age- 34 inches and he couldnt walk in it as it was dragging along the ground. The quality is very nice, we have always used Halo Sleep sacks, but this I had to return as the sizing was so far off. I do not recommend you buy this unless you intend to use it for a 2 or 3 yr old.",1
"Crazy Cuddly Wolf Melamine Spoon, Crazy Cuddly Wolf","these are so cute, I wish there were matching forks!  I bought 2 of these and after 3 months, 1 of them broke. It is a somewhat hard plastic. I wash them in the dishwasher about 3-4 times/week so heavy use might explain the breaking.  The one we have left still looks like new and our kids enjoy using it.",4
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,"We bought this walker for our son when he was 10 months old. It's terrible and I am surprised that Fisher-Price would market such a dangerous toy! It's too heavy in the front and tips easily. If you use it on a hard floor, it moves way too fast for a beginner walker. My son tried to walk with it and fell flat on his face! The wheel popped off a couple of times. And the space between the two legs is too narrow and my son kept getting his feet caught in the legs!The only saving grace to this terrible toy is the fact that my son likes to press the nose to hear the music!VERY DISAPPOINTING!Kathy - mom to 2 yr old",1

"Baby Jogger City Classic Single Stroller, Black &amp; Stone","I got this stroller to replace two former jogging strollers that just didn't meet my needs.  I am so happy that after tons of research I decided to go with the Baby Jogger City Classic.  The pros: Deep seat (big enough for a large two year old- with more room to grow), huge sun shade, flat seat recline, super easy fold with one hand, compact when folded (only takes up half the trunk of my Ford Escape), great for brisk walking on uneven sidewalks, roomy basket underneath and back of seat pocket, see-through windows in sun shade, 14in. back tires are not as bulky as standard 16in. jogger, adjustable handle bar, plenty of leg room for child. The cons: not made for serious jogging, smaller rear tires not as sturdy as the large 16in. tire on typical joggers, larger tires=smoother ride (but also more bulky if using in the mall or fitting in trunk of car), no cup holder (but I bought a great one at Babies R US for $6), rear of seat of this stroller is not vented when reclined- it's just solid material all the way around which doesn't allow for good air-flow on a hot day.  The demo. video on the Baby Jogger website shows a different version (maybe the City Elite) with a vented seat.  I bought this one thinking the seat was vented, but was disappointed that wasn't the case... Other than that one feature that I would've liked, this stroller is Great!  It is a much better value than BOB and has just as many features.  I'm very satisfied with my Baby Jogger.  Also- it has a jump seat that you can purchase if you have a baby and a toddler and don't like the bulk of an enormous double stroller.",4
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow, Enchanting Elephants","First off, let me say that a nursing pillow is a must-have in my book for a newborn.  It allows for them to lay there and nurse (24/7) while allowing you to have 2 hands free to do other things, like eat.  It really takes a load off when nursing.  Yea, holding a little baby is no big deal...until you are doing it 24/7 for the 10th night in a row (with no end in sight), you're exhausted, still healing from giving birth, tired from having to heal, produce milk, and being a slave to your little bundle of joy.  When that time comes, it's great to be able to sit down, pull up the nursing pillow, put baby into position to nurse, then revel in the freedom your arms have to put food in your mouth, research on the iPad on all things baby, order more things from Amazon that you now realize you need, or just drop dead at your sides (don't underestimate how good this will feel).  So having said that - I would recommend this particular pillow if you have a tiny little waist.  Look at the picture and pay attention to that small little opening you have to get the pillow on.  So I have to really pull it outwards to get it around my waist, then it hugs me real tight.  The Boppy pillows are not designed like this.  The old style Boppy doesn't hold on at all and the new Boppy has a waist-strap that is completely ineffective and annoying.  Point is - I actually prefer having nothing holding onto my waist than this tension grip.  If you look at close ups of the edges of this pillow, you'll see it has a ridge sewn in all around.  This is a very pretty and nice touch, but it leaves that imprint in your waist. Maybe if I was a smaller waisted person it would be more comfortable?  Now, having pressure up against your belly can help it shrink back down, so some people might really love this feature...for me, it just wasn't all that comfortable.Other than that, this pillow is very nicely made.  It has a flatter/firmer/more organized surface than the Boppy's which seem to be more of just a pillow.  This pillow also has a vibration feature.  There's a small, round thing that vibrates.  You need to put a C battery in (not included) and put it in the middle of the pillow.  There is a zippered opening just for this purpose.  To turn it on and off, you press on it through the pillow.  Easy enough.  I'm not sure how much vibration comforted my baby, it didn't seem to be a huge factor, but it didn't hurt any and it's always good to have options.  The materials, colors, patterns on this pillow is much superior to the Boppys (old and new), but I don't like the sewn in ridged border and I did end up preferring the softer, cuddlier Boppy.  This pillow feels more like a heavily padded little platform.  A lot of this is going to be personal preference.  I do feel like this is a very high quality and extremely attractive pillow with a unique vibrating feature.I would recommend it based on that.  But personal preference...if you want something softer, cuddlier...then maybe look into the Boppy pillow.  Now I wasn't completely happy with my Boppy's either.  They are just glorified pillows - but they worked waayy better than just regular pillows.  If I had to do it again, I would try out other options.  I heard &#34;My Best Friend&#34; pillow has great reviews.  That one just seemed so big and bulky to me.",3
The Shrunks Wheeled Travel Bag,"Easy to inflate and deflate - great pump that has adapters for other size valves like air mattresses, etc.  I like how a normal sized crib sheets fits and tucks nicely in the recessed area.  Will be taking it on a 1 week trip soon.  Oh and we also bought the roller bag made for it which seems to hold not only the bed and pump, but also extra sheets, air mattresses, another inflatable pool items.  Highly recommend!",5
Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"My baby is still young, but I used this because her gums were hurting- she hates her teething ring and I'm too nervous to let her gnaw on a chunk of frozen fruit.  But at the suggestion of my husband, I put a frozen cube of milled pear that I made in the feeder and she loved it!  I didn't have to worry about her getting any chunks and unlike some feeders, these bags are mesh fabric, not plastic so no little bits to break off.  It was pretty easy to clean, just strong stream of hot water and a sponge.  It did require a few tries to get all of the bits of strained pear out, but it didn't take long at all.  Although, if left to sit for even a few minutes, I imagine it would be a great deal more difficult.  I'm very happy with this product and it's been a great way to introduce foods to my daughter (who also dislikes baby spoons!).",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This is an ideal accessory for the infant who's big enough to fit into it.  We put our grandson in one of these 2 days before he was officially 6 months old.  He was just big enough to fit into it, and he loved it.  He was first smitten with the flashing lights with noise, and in a very short time he'd learned he could activate the light show by spinning the roller thing.  After about half an hour playing with the visual distractions, he was jumping in it.  At first he could only make a few jumps before tiring, but now, 2 months later, he can jump like a champ for longer periods, and he loves doing it.  I think this will really help get him started walking.  A great, useful toy all in all.",5
"Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Seat with Latch System, Sailor",Love the anchor and it's a great booster seat for my 5 yr old. It's simple and pretty design was a hit with my daughter.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My daughter is 11 weeks old and suffers from severe acid reflux. She cannot lay down flat or she vomits and chokes. It is definatly the scariest thing we have ever been through! She slept in her bouncy seat for about 7 weeks. She is now moving/wiggling around quite a bit and the bouncy seat is just not safe for her anymore (even with the belt on). I got the sleeper about 6 days after I ordered it. It was SUPER easy to put together, did it by myself. I set her in it and she was asleep within minutes. She LOVES it! She sleeps through the night now and is taking longer naps during the day. We are ALL getting more sleep now! It is very easy to move around the house and it fits perfectly next to my bed. It keeps her upright so she cant choke and if she rolls to her side she is still able to breathe through the mesh. It is HONESTLY the safest sleeping option for babies that cant lay flat or that do not like their crib. The best baby product we've purchased BY FAR!",5
Blue Water Teether Baby Toy,I found this exact teether in pink and blue @ the 99cent only store!!! What a great price:)great to use as a baby shower gift!!! directions say to place in the fridge but my child loves when it comes out of the freezer:),5
"Carters Snoozysnug Blanket, Green/Brown","We received so many baby blankets, but the problem I have with most is that they shed and attract fuzzies from anything else you washed or dried the blanket with.  I spend a lot of time checking my baby's hands and removing all the lint and fuzzues that accumulated from him touching or grabbing the blanket.  This Snoozysnug blanket is the only blanket so far that hasn't done so.  It is so soft and my baby loves it!  It's also nice and thick unlike most baby blankets.  Seems like this blanket will be used even in his toddler years.  I bought it in sage since I had received the yellow monkey one as a gift.  I think I'll buy more to have as backups!",5
"Jeep Deluxe All-Weather Umbrella Stroller, Carbon",I love the Jeep style design of this model and the fabric and top bonnet for rain is a really nice feature and so easy to snap on and use quickly when needed. It also has a velcro cover and you can pull that up to take a quick check on the baby without having to stop and walk to the front every time.  This window is very large and you can see well through it too.It is heavier than a basic stroller and probably is not as easy to open with one hand as the lighter ones are so I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that too. The lighter ones I have used almost fall all the way open and this needs more coaxing.  Once the seat belt (harness) is adjusted right I just open and close the one side and never have to unbuckle the whole thing.  I read that someone here had problems with the wheels on sand and other terrain but I use this mostly on sidewalks and the wheels have been really good there. This comes with one cup holder and two side bags that Velcro closed that you can put fish crackers or other snacks in easily.  There is also a large storage area under the seat that is great to store a baby blanket and things like that.  You just have to make sure nothing there is too heavy because it already hangs lower to the ground and depending on the terrain could get smashed or bump into the ground.  On the sidewalks I have no problem with it.  The foot bar seems well made and says JEEP across it which seemed like a nice touch to me.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"There are so many different ""hidden"" treasures on this toy.  I didn't even notice the embroidered ladybug under one of the wings until a couple months of Sofia using the toy.  She loves, loves, loves this one... even though she didn't get really interested in it until about 3 months of age.  She is now 5 1/2 months and still loves to play with this.Her favorite part about this toy is the crinkle noise it makes, so we have bought many, many other crinkle toys.  Still, this is her favorite.",5
Mommy's Touch One-size Touchtape All in One Cloth Diaper (Lime),"We love these diapers.  We've have several brands of diapers.  This is the only One-Size true AIO I have been able to find.  My husband is dumbfounded that I even bothered with buying pocket diapers or those with snaps.  These are always the first diapers we reach for - they require no pre-folding or stuffing.  Now, that might not sound like such a big deal but when you work full-time and are taking care of a baby, the last thing you need to worry about is stuffing and putting away diapers every other day.  After these are washed and dried, we put them in a laundry bag and keep the bag by her changing table- you can just grab them as you need them.  Plus, pulling soiled liners out of a pocket diaper is gross and why do it if it's not necessary?  These fit her great after she was about 11 lbs (we used disposables for the first few months), they never leak and she seems comfortable.  Yes - they are bulkly but all cloth diapers are - you just have to buy bigger clothes.  Give these a try - I think you'll like them!",5
Child's Maple Wood Bowl and Spoon Set,Its great that its wooden and teething babies love to chew on the spoonBut I thought that price was overly expensive.I would recommend it but if you 've got time look for bargain,3
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,"True to its name, the package has lots of links (24!). My 6 month old daughter likes to chew on them and they are handy for keeping toys attached to the stroller, car seat, etc. I gave four stars though because sometimes the links get easily detached.",4
Oops! Sheet Waterproof Infant Toddler Car Seat Protector Cover,"I think this is a great product, but it doesn't fit my carseat. My seat has those added head protectors that come out and are part of the seat. I already washed the lining when I realized it wouldn't work, but I did spread the cover out on the bottom part of my seat (not ideal) to use it as a piddle pad in desperation and it saved my seat when the other piddle pad on top of it leaked pee pee. Hope to see this liner in a version that fits the Safety 1st AIR seats (with the head air cushions). This is a great product especially for slightly damp children coming from pools or the beach in the summer. Very sad I can't use it the way Id like. Especially because I spent a bit of money.",4
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter Duallie for Chicco,"This is only good until your younger infant can ride in the seat then it's absolutely useless, basically useless after 6 months. I don't understand why bob can't come up with just an adapter with no snack tray. Getting my almost 3 year old in and out of the seat is such a pain with the tray there.",2
"Luvable Friends 12 Pack Washcloths, Blue","They're a little stretchy but I have no problems with that! My baby girl loves these and they're slightly bigger (and softer!) than the baby washcloths we bought in stores. Love the fabric, great price for so many in a pack, and she's more than happy to teeth on them too.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I was very excited to try these with the hopes of phasing out the disposables. I read other reviews regarding their absorbency so when I received them I put them through the wash a few times. I have had no problems at all with them not retaining fluid. However, they are quite thick and very noticeable through fitted clothing. Under lose fitting clothes is fine though. Also, not ideal for overnight simply because they are hard to keep in place.",3
Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,"This sticks to the wall of my tile shower better than any suction cup device ever has, it hasn't come off in the 3 weeks I've been using it.  Great for shaving, not built to carry weight.",5

"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I bought these to dispose of litter box waste. I had been using regular plastic bags from the grocery store, but found them to be flimsy and have too many holes. These are scented and are the perfect size for daily scoops.  They'd also be perfect for dogs.",5
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Gliding Bassinet,"The Zen collection is not wood, but impersonates a wooden look so if you buy it online you dont know until after you receive it, that's its plastic.I had originally registered for the collections because of wanting wood - and later found out it's not.",1
"Skip Hop Take Cover Shopping Cart/High Chair Cover, Double Dots",I have been looking for a cart cover but all the ones I found were very bulky and I couldn't imagine bring it to the store or restaurants.  I just received this and haven't use it yet (my son is not quite sitting on his own yet) but I already love it.  It isn't bulky and folds into itself.  When in the pouch I would say it is about the size of a water bottle.I will update my review if I change my mind after using it but I can't wait to give it a shot.,5
"Baby Buddy Size-It Closet Organizers, Blue, 5 Pack",Im not one to review stuff but these things work awesome! They have been stepped on(put in a bag during a move) and still perfect condition! =) love that ot comes with more stickers to replace once you need to make a bigger one! Definitely makes closet organization easier,5
"Britax B-Agile and B-Safe Travel System, Red",We have had no issues with this product at all. There was a recent safety recall on the stroller of which Britax immediately sent us a simple repair kit since our product was registered. Very good experience with our 10 months of using this product so far!!!,5

"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","The tip about taping half the air output port works somewhat, but that's no excuse for this thing being really poor to begin with. Additional problems include a *screwed-in* battery compartment, incredible noisiness, and very high likelihood that your child will get his finger pinched/mangled when they inevitably shove their hand into the cute penguin's rotating death mouth.",2
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","This holds all the doodads from the Dr. Brown's bottles, and I don't mind having it sit out since it's attractive. I don't have any pooling water or mold or anything, but the two pieces can pop into the dishwasher anytime.",5
Disney Babies Mickey Mouse &amp; Minnie Mouse Fleece Blanket,Super cute item! It's not easy finding baby Mickey items ! This is perfect ! Looks identical to the picture! The baby M & M are really cute & the picture shows the true color :),5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"My sister in law gave this to me for my first child after she used it to help nurse her two sons. After helping me with my first and second child, I now gave it to my other sister in law. For a first time mother,nervous about nursing she was able to pump 3 oz her first day home with the newborn (1st time to ever use a pump) and 6 oz her next time she needed to use it. I was happy to help her out with such a realiable product at such a delicate time. To think that pump is 6 years old!!!!!",5
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess",The beauty of The FIrst Years Sippy cups is they do not have a valve but instead rely on a small rubberized hole on top of the lid to regulate the flow. No valve to lose or go bad. Much easier to wash and sanitize. I could not be happier,5
Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad,"I take long car trips every month and have found this pad to be a lifesaver! On occasion, my 2 year old son will spill his juice or wet through his diaper. All I have to do at that point is change my son, take the pad off the seat, and put another pad on the seat. Much easier than dealing with a wet seat! I have 4 pads total, 2 for each car seat, for my two sons. These pads hold the liquid or wetness in them, and allow the carseat to stay completely dry. When I get home, I wash the soiled pad in the washer and let it drip dry. So easy! Well worth the purchase!",5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",This product works great for my 20 month old. Fits almost all juice boxes. Easy to clean. This is perfect for toddlers who have just started drinking juice boxes!,5
Infantino Light and Sound Ball Musical Toy,NOt good toy NOt good toy NOt good toy NOt good toySound and sensors are not working well together it didnt  hold my boys attention at any age!!! Waste of money !,1
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months",Best product I've bought in a while. Very well thought out and visually appealing. Love that you can freeze the dip section to keep it cold. The covers are awesome and seal well. I've had it over a week and used it every day. My son loves it too.,5
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Mosaic Marble - Certified Baltic Amber &amp; Resin Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),So pretty.  I lost my toddlers previous amber necklace.  I do think they work most of the time.  She loves her new necklace.,5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"Item was as described. Love it! Shipment was pretty fast too. Was expecting a little bit sooner, but can't complain too much. Great Product!",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",I love the design and it's the right size for kids going to day care or starting kindy. You can write your child's name inside in a designated area which is good to prevent your kid's belongings getting lost.,5
"Bibimals Baby Bibs (Safari Pack) Button Latch Better for Long Hair - Funny Cool Cute 2 Pack of Bibs with Food Catcher Pocket Made From Waterproof Washable Silicone Plastic, Best for Use with Girl or Boy Infants and Babies - Your Baby Will Love These Silly Animal Face Bibs, Great Baby Shower Gift, Lifetime Guarantee - [Add These Bibs to Your Baby Registry Today]",Awesome product. Easy to use and clean. Baby loves it! No issues so far. The button could be a little easier to close and open.,5
"Nuby Nibbler Food Vegetable, Colors May Vary",This is such a great idea and big help in allowing our daughter to feed herself and get more food in her tummy than on her clothes. We cut up bananas and our daughter held on to the nibbler like a spoon and sucked out most of the food. Looking forward to trying other foods. The downside is that it is a huge pain to clean so I might go and get two more so that I can alternate and use the dishwasher. I would have given it more stars if it had been easier to clean.,4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have used the older version of the drop-ins, where you have to fold them over the top of the bottle, and they leaked. I have also used the version of drop-ins that do not expand. Well needless to say this version is their best yet. They don't leak and they hold enough liquid without spilling over the top of the bottle.",5
Hallmark 2012 Keepsake Ornaments QXD1601 Winnie The Pooh Baby's First Christmas,I found the perfect ornament for my grandson. I forgot to pick up one from 2012 and I found this one. It was perfect! My daughter-in-law loved it too!,5
"Graco Sweet Snuggle Infant Soothing Swing, Jacqueline","My daughter is 9 weeks old and purchasing a swing was essential! When it arrived we were very pleased. It is very pretty and easy to assemble. Once our baby arrived we found it to be a lifesaver! She absolutely loved it and it rocked her to sleep in no time while I was doing other things. We love that you can change the position of the seat, as the side to side motion didn't seem to please her after about a week, but the back and forth is very soothing to her. The other day however, we noticed that even though it was on the number 2 setting (which it had always been on) it was swinging very fast, as if it was on the number 6 setting! So, we put it down to the 1 setting and that would be fine for awhile, but would slow down to almost stopping and then speed back up to a 6 for a few seconds and then slow back down. Now it is doing half swings and then stopping completely. The motor is blown. Very disappointed that after such a short amount of time we are having to either replace the motor or the entire swing. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Too much of a hassle for any new mom to deal with.",3
Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,"Not only did they arrive quickly, but there was no trouble with fit. It is great to be able to just replace the valves and not throw away the entire cup.",5
"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory","Simple installation yet when done correctly it will not simply ""pop off"" as some suggest. Its sturdy, simple design does what you'd expect it to do.Really can't ask for more for a product that costs less than $10. I'd buy another if one wasn't enough.",5
Graco RoomFor2 Stand &amp; Ride Stroller - Lotus,"So happy with the stroller.  This stroller is so lightweight and collapses to smaller than my travel system Graco stroller.  My kids are thrilled that they each have their own seat and cup holder!  Really easy to set-up and collapse.  The only downside is that when collapsed, the fabric touches the ground/floor...but it is the underside so it's not too big of a deal.  The pop of red on the black looks great too!  I think it is a wonderful value and will work out just perfect for our trip to Disney and any subsequent trips to the zoo, park, or just going to walks.  This is the sit and strand stroller to buy!!!!",5
"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Happy Floral, Large",This wearable blanket is great.  It is really well thought out and well made.  It is comfortable for the baby and easy for the parents.  I have no complaints.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny","I purchased this when my son was very young and it was one of the first baby holder type items I got. My favorite thing about it is how snugly my son would sit in it when he was a new born.  It's almost like a rock n play  in its snugness with the newborn insert, and without it as well as your baby grows. My baby is not amused by the vibration or the music though, but every baby is different. I purchased this before I really knew what a bouncer was, so understand that if you want it to bounce your baby needs to wiggle around a lot or you can bounce it yourself by hand.  My son didn't even notice the birds really until almost here months old and when it soon came time to want to grab them they are always out of his reach which both of us find annoying.  I'm not sure why the toy bar is so high. At four months he still can't reach them, so I guess they aren't meant to be grabbed or batted at by baby.",3
The First Years Clean Air Filter Replacement 2 pk,I don't know why I even bother to purchase this product. My diaper genie still smells bad whether I put new filter in or not.,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath.,5
Infantino Compact 2-in-1 Shopping Cart Cover,"I recieved this as a gift at one of my baby showers. I thought it was going to be great, but it is a big old mess. There are way to many folds and pockets, took me 5 minutes just to get it onto the cart. And the folds into a handy compact. Yea right, I'm not sure a genius could fold this thing back up into the little carrying case it claims to fold into. It is very cute, but not very user friendly.",2
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Sketchy Sport, Large","I just don't have any use for the zipper functionality of this blanket.  I never left the baby swaddled up and unzipped the bottom to change a diaper.  The zipper doesn't detract from the design it just doesn't add to it at all.  The material is very soft and cozy, and the swaddle straps are just so cozy and wonderful!  My baby loves to be all snuggled up in it and I swear it helps him sleep longer and better.",4
The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty System,"Natalie is already using the potty and loving it She learns very fast, she takes after her grandmother. Better not tell the grandpa.",5
Baby Jogger Adjustable Belly Bar,"I bought this bar for our double City Mini and our twin boys love it! I bought it when they were 10 months old and right away they loved pulling themselves forward on it so they could look around and see each other better. I read one review that said this added width to the stroller, which would have been an issue for me since its a double, but the bar did not make the stroller any wider. I am very happy with the purchase!",5
"Nautica Kids Drew Mini Twin Set, Blue/White","Picture looks much better than the actual product.  The quality of this comforter was disappointing for the price (colors, pattern, and overall appearance). It looks like a cheap ""bed-in-a-bag"" set in person.  Not only the appearance is cheap, but also the feel of the material.  I expected a smooth, soft cotton but it is stiffer and more uncomfortable-feeling than I anticipated.  With the poor quality, I don't think a run through the washing machine will even help.  In fact, I'd be worried about this thing falling apart if I tried to wash it, which really stinks since I'm sure most people (like myself) are buying this for a child's room.I expected much better from Nautica.  My husband agrees that the online picture of this quilt does not compare with the quilt in person.  So, that makes two of us. Sorry to disappoint those of you who saw the picture and fell in love like my son and I did, but I wouldn't waste your money or time like I am now doing by packaging this thing back up and sending it back for a refund.",1
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","Very sturdy bag and gender-neutral (read: my husband will carry it).Problems:- So many pockets actually make it hold less: trying to carry one child's things including some bottles and a change of clothes, maybe a toy, and it is too full for the diaper to zip- It claims to have an insulated section but it is really an insulated pocket on the side for a bottle but the top is open...so not really insulated- Front flap just for show.  Pretty useless for organization",3
"Luvable Friends 6-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets, Blue",These blankets are really small! However they are really nice to have around when spit up happens. I would rather have these than a burp cloth any day!,3
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Mini Bassinet, Natural","This thing was a beast. Very heavy and clumsy. I could see using it as a non-travel bassinet. It is difficult to collapse, fit in the perfectly sized bag, and on top of that, it is really heavy, like 30 pounds heavy. There is another review that is similar to this one.",2
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black","Attached easily to the combi twin sport. I will use it with my Chicco keyfit carseat which fits snuggly in the combi.  Great option for a little extra security. Did not come with any type of instructions, and took me a minute to figure out how to attach it. I did not open the metal loops, but instead slipped the one end through the loop making a loop around the bar of the stroller ( if that makes sense)  Overall, for the price it was exactly what I was looking for to add some extra security in holding together a non-matching carseat and stroller.",4
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"The suction cup does not suction and within an hour of hanging, it would fall off. Usually after the little one would go to sleep and make a loud BANG in the tub. I returned it. Haven't found anything better yet.",1
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack","This is one of the best breastfeeding products I have ever tried. Especially usefull for the first few weeks. They keep clothing off of sensitive nipples, which makes things much more comfortable. They also allowed me to collect several ounces of breastmilk at each feeding to freeze for later. that liquid gold would have gone to waste otherwise!! I have told all of my pregnant friends to get them and will be recommending them to everyone who will listen. more than worth the money!",5
Performance Carrier Color: Charcoal Black,"my favorite carrier of all time. We also have an original carrier, which we use for our infant, and this one is for our 19 month old! Using it all over the world.",5
Lamaze My First Purse Baby Toy,This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.  We enjoyed watching her play with it. Kid friendly and well made.,5
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I've had the same set of OsoCozy prefolds for a year.  Each diaper has been used and washed at least once a day-- usually more often-- and still not so much as a frayed corner on any of them.  Very absorbent, and they only seem to get softer with washing.  Superb prefolds.  Be aware that these are much too large for newborns, though.  I have the OsoCozy Indian Cotton newborn size 4x6x4 which were perfect for the first months.  The quality of the smaller size is equally excellent, and they remain useful as extra diaper padding or diaper cloths into toddler-hood.  Couldn't recommend more highly!",5
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink",This hamper does exactly what it is supposed to do. It holds dirty clothes in a very stylish way. Matches our baby's room with the adorable owls. I love the removable mesh liner inside so I can just grab it and go to the laundry room. I would definitely recommend this product!,5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink",The only swaddle my baby can't break out of! I bought this for my 10 week old who was breaking out of swaddles within minutes of putting him down! I wasn't really sure how this worked but it basically uses baby's own weight to keep his arms cozy and comfy. I would definitely recommend this to parents whose babies break out of swaddles easily but need to be swaddled to fall asleep- and stay asleep!Another nice side effect is my baby seems to associate being all wrapped up in this with sleep and is falling asleep much quicker and with a lot less fuss!,5
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"Great simple design - much better than the bulky full size cribs which are often tacky. Great for small spaces, I am so happy with my purchase.",4
"Nuby Paci Cradle Pacifier Box, Colors may vary","It's fairly straightforward and simple, which is what we like about it.  It can hold 2 (maybe 3 if they're small and flexible) pacifiers.  The hanging portion of the holder has a 'split-ring' design so that it easy to hook onto our stroller or any other loop.It's made of stiff plastic, which actually works out well for us.  Because it keeps it shape, it has less of a chance of getting lost in the diaper bag.  Rather than using Ziploc bags, which always seemed a little 'eh' this works well.  It's also easy to stay organized--a pacifier in the case is clean, everything else is assumed to be dirty.",5
"Waterproof Pull On Pants Potty Scotty/PottyPatty, Large","these are great waterproof pants for potty training. they are soft and hold up in repeated washes. they do run big, really big. buying a size down will spare you some leaks.",4
"Leachco Easy Teether XL Side Crib Rail Cover, 2 Pack, Brown",My daughter actually eats the wood on her crib! This stops her and it matches her crib perfectly. Love it!,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Jumperoo,,5
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* - Mixed Colors - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN THE USA),I haven't noticed too much difference when using the necklace vs. when not using it.  It's cute and I am able to knot it once then wrap it twice around baby's ankle.  If I don't see any improvement in the next few weeks I will take it off my son and put it on my ankle to see if it helps relieve any of my own aches and pains.,3
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","After washing, the mattress cover seems too short and is difficult to put on, especially length-wise.  I wouldn't order it again.",3
"Zebra Baby Blanket in Faux Fur with Black Satin Ruffle and Ultra Lux Plush White Swirl on Back, An Alexander Timothy Designer Baby Throw",I love it! It is a smaller blanket but I knew that when I bought it. Very nice and so soft. I would recommend it to anyone.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I purchased this as a gift for a shower.  My friend loved it and looks forward to using it.  It shipped fast too.,5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Light up &amp; Go Turtle Soother,I use this light on my nightstand every night for the overnight feedings.  It has enough light and it's easy to just push the turtle.  My son really likes watching the turtle in his bassinet too.  It holds his attention for as long as it runs.  It's a good product!  My only complaint is that I wish the light stayed on longer-no big deal though.,4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","I bought a couple of these for my DaVinci Emily mini crib.  They fit over both the 3"" thick mattress I got as well as the mattress pad that came with the crib (not sure if it's in the listing, but these sheets fit up to 5"" mattresses).  They're pretty thin, but they get the job done.",4
Diaper Dekor Plus 2-Pack Refill Biodegradable,"I purchased the biodegradable version of the dekor refill bags without realizing it. After days of wondering why our daughter's room suddenly always smelled of poo, we realized these bags do not block odors at all. Besides, are the disposable diapers biodegradable? I don't think so. If you're really concerned with being environmentally sensitive, I suggest going with reusable diapers. Otherwise, stick with the non-biodegradable diaper pail bags!",1
Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"WIth a new baby, this is a lifesaver!  My son can do all his pottying duty's on his own without me running in to turn the faucet on for him.",5
All Star Sports Wall Decal Stickers by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 4 Sheets,The item worked well and was easy to apply. It made my twin boys nursery look great.  I am satisfied with this product.,5
"Green Eats Divided Tray, Blue","Nice size, soft edges, simple functional.  One fatal flaw, despite being labeled in the plastic on the bottom, and on the box as dishwasher safe, it melted and warped with it's first washing. This tray is NOT dishwasher safe. They melt. Luckily, it did not catch fire.",1
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"Lets just say that Steve Jobs was not in the same country as the design team for this pump. It is awful, which I can say after 7 months of use.  I can't believe we spent this much money on a pump that barely does the job, and is so finicky that using it is a constant headache. The battery frequently loses contact with any jostling or bump, which means that the unit has to be plugged in CONTINUOUSLY for 24 hours.  So, while it was sitting on my desk at work and the back cover came slightly lose for no clear reason, the battery wiggled, and I had to drive home for 20 minutes, interrupting the 24hour recharging cycle, so it was useless the next day without being plugged in.  This happens about every month.The ""hands free"" system is absurd.  Really?  3 different straps that attach to a bra?  Do you think I wear the same bra every day?8 separate parts to wash after every pump session???louddoesn't suck very wellthe clip on the back doesn't hang on to anything, because it's too small and is embedded within plastic so it takes 3 hands to attach it to anything, except perhaps the ""included belt"" - like 1950's Modess.  really?  I can't just clip it on to my PANTS?  Oh, right, I guess I'm supposed to be wearing a dress...The buttons are slightly raised nubs, and because I can't clip it on to anything, I end up holding it, and invariably pushing some button about every minute or so.I hate this pump. I hate Madela for making such an awful, poorly designed pump that they charged me a humongous amount of money for.  I want it back.",1
"Sassy On the Go Feeding Set, Blue","I bought this at some point when my son was a baby and now that he is in kindergarten I'm still using it! I find that I use the smaller containers for things like ketchup, raisins, etc. and don't usually put them in the larger container which I use for things like sandwiches, spaghetti, or chicken fingers. I like that I can fit this AND a water bottle into my sons lunch box where some of the other containers are too large for both. Also, these are bpa free! Not sure why they aren't advertising as such but that was one of the main reasons I picked this up.[...]",4
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I have also read great reviews about the diaper dekor while I was pregnant and decided to get it, but it is terrible, whenever I put a diaper in there and the lid opens up the smell of poop comes out and into the room, we coulnt take it anymore the fact that the nursery smelled like poop most of the time even though I changed the bag way before it was time to. Now I take the poopy diaper, put it in a plastic bag and throw it in the kitcken garbage which we take out almost twice a day.  I would not recommend this product",1
Munchkin Jelly Bean Cargo Sling,"My sister bought this years ago before it was recalled and let me use it with my son who is now almost 4 months.  I have been using it [barely] for about 3 months now, only because it's all I have.  Even since my son was itty bitty [7 lbs at 1 month when I started using it] it was SOO uncomfortable!  I just put him in it today and he is about 13 lbs and I took it off after literally 30 seconds.  It kills my neck and back and there is no comfortable way to wear it.  Then as I was researching if there was another carrying position I could try, I found out it was recalled for safety issues.  Worst carrier ever!  Don't buy this-put your money towards something more comfortable and safe!",1
Summer Infant 3 Piece Dr. Mom Oral Care Set,"These little set is absolutely the most perfect gateway into teeth-brushing on the planet. Okay, I may be mildly exaggerating, but it really is wonderful! You can tell the company spent some time and money researching the 3 best items to include in a starter set. The squishy finger &#34;cap&#34; is great - my daughter (15 mos) loves to chew on it with a little tooth gel. The brush and gum massager (our least favorite item) have big handles that are easy to maneuver for parents.New moms: if this isn't on your registry, add it. And, if you're looking for a practical gift for a new mom, you must get this! It's an essential that a lot of new moms don't think about right away. It's one of those things that's great to have on hand once the toofies start coming in! :)",5
"LA Baby 3&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","The mattress my crib came with is better described as a pad (and barely that).  This mattress is plush, without being too soft, and works perfectly for the new baby.  It is also the perfect thickness for the sheets to fit correctly.",5
Tommee Tippee Travel Bottle and Food Warmer,This is perfect for us on the go. We boil water before we go and it is enough for two warming jobs while out. Easily refillable at a gas station coffee pot with hot water. Water stays same temp well over 12 hours. The plastic cover is perfect size for our wide bottles. Definitely worth it!,5
"Thirsties 3 Pack Boys Fab Doublers Soft Cotton Velour, Ocean Blue/Meadow/White, Large","Buy these! The price is a steal for the quality, softness, and incredible absorption you get!After a much disappointing absorption performance of Joey's Bunz Babykicks Hemp Premium Inserts (3-pack in the large - I gave it a ONE star review! If you were considering those, get the Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2-pack Large instead! - Click and see my review -Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs), and pretty much coming to the conclusion that I had paid $21 dollars for a set of Babykicks hemp inserts with the absorptive abilities of a couple sheets of paper towel, I decided to use these (Thirsties 3-pack Girls Doublers) whenever using those awful Babykicks Joeys-Bunz inserts.Eureka! Talk about doublers that are SUPER SOFT and aptly called THIRSTY! They gobble up loads of wetness to keep the little one cozy and dry. I cannot emphasize enough just how soft the cotton velour on these are! Think of the softest fleece you have felt, then you will begin to get the idea BUT SOFTER! They are very durable as well, and you can tell straight out the box, they went the extra mile to ensure top construction. Personally, after trying out several various brands of inserts, doublers, and liners, if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased these thirsties doublers (for overnight use) or for super-extended no change periods these (inside diaper next to baby's skin -thin fleece liner recommended option to serve bm's barrier) and a Thirsties Hemp InsertThirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs.As for my 3 Babykicks Joey's Bunz Hemp premium inserts, I am tempted to throw them out because they are utterly useless. They aren't soft enough to place directly next to baby's delicate skin so cannot be used as a liner, and with such limited absorbency (a kitchen sponge absorbs more liquid) that they are useless as a ""doubler"" or any use where soaking up liquid is a must.If i were not as green as I am, these would already be in the trash. Perhaps I can donate them to a seamstress and have them recycled into something of use.Okay, back to the Thirsties 3-pack Doublers! I cannot say enough positive things! Really, get these and do not let the low price trick you! These should be selling for over $15/$20 based on performance alone! They are softer, better constructed and more absorptive than products costing 3 times as much.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"These are nice because my baby lunges for the food hardcore and could conceivably impale himself on a metal spoon. Also nice to have so many as he invariably grabs the spoon and chews on it, finally throwing it to the floor.",5
Tiny Love My Nature Pals Mobile,We needed a mobile for our son's crib at daycare.This one has a bunch of great reviews so we decided to go with it.The mobile works perfectly and I would recommend to anyone looking for a versatile mobile!,5

"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","So far this bag is working excellently for our cloth diapers and we have had it for three months.  Holds moisture/ small amounts of liquids in as well as keeping smells contained. The only suggestion to the design team is to make a larger/stronger zipper pull as this one seems very fragile and I'm afraid I will overuse it.  The small zipper pull also makes it difficult to open at times.  With my postpartum finger numbness, grasping a tiny zipper is tedious.*When washing pull inner liner out of fabric bag so nothing fills with water. I dry for a few minutes in the dryer to help the fabric along and hang for the remainder.",4
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I got this because so many people raved about them but my son does not really like being in it. I started putting him in it around 10 months after using the baby Bjorn. While it is more comfortable for me, it can be hard to get him in and out. He also doesn't like sitting so low. He is much happier in a backpack carrier where his head is up near mine.",3
Soho Butterflies Garden Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I'm very worried because i have just buy this set and i 've seen several comments (BAD) about it.i will return back to you my comments when i get it in my hands, in a few days.Soho please, send me a high quality bedding set!!PLEASE!! i 'm worried",3

"Hoppop Bato Bath Tub, Lime","I wish they would have thought about slippery bottom And include rubber mat with order, it's expensive enough to have it. Other than that, after I bought green sprout baby bath mat and 5 pack tiny bath mats, she is enjoying her bath time and we do 2. Also the hole for draining leaves some water inside which could lead to mold, I wish it was thought a bit thorough. But I still love it, looks great, feels great.",4

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack","My son and I love these bottles, they are our bottles of choice. I like the shape, design, everything. They also have less pieces (less pieces to lose) than some other bottles that I have, so that's a plus.",5
Keekaroo Comfort Cushion Set - Cherry,"I purchased these cushions at the same time as I ordered the highchair thinking they'd be necessary. However, the chair got here 2 weeks before the cushions and my son was fine with the pad that came with it. When they finally got here I was a little disappointed with the material. I was under the impression that it was going to be made with a faux suede like material, but it was more like the bumbo seat polyurethane stuff. It's easy to clean still so I kinda got over it.So I did struggle a bit with initially putting the cushions on. I had to take the crotch bar thing off to get the bottom pad to fit, then I had to lengthen the rear seat belt straps a lot(which was actually very hard to do), since there weren't any holes for them to go through in the cushion. The back pad was hard to get in at first, but I can easily handle it now, when my son manages to wiggle enough to get it off.Another thing that bothers me that is an ongoing issue is that the bottom cushion comes out almost every day. If my baby boy is not too excited to eat for some reason he is easily able to kick the cushion out from under himself as I'm putting him in, which is a little annoying. On the other hand if he's having a great time and bopping around in it the cushion slides out again.However, I decided to keep the cushions, since they do add nice cushion for times when I need to do chores that are going to take a while and he has no problem at all sitting there for even 45 minutes with them. He even likes to put his arm up on the flap that comes out from the back pad and rest his head and watch me sometimes.. :)",3
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"Light and easy to put on the table or take off with one hand. small enough to fit in the diaper bag and sturdy enough to hold my 2 year old. Be careful, it does not fit all tables. We have run across problems with tables that have a lip, and sometimes tables in restaurants are just too thick. But this has been only a few times. Prepare for a lot of comments! Everyone walking by your table will say how cool they think it is and what a great idea.We purchased this item in 2004 and are still using it, now for our second child. I have purchased one for 3 of my other friends who eat out a lot. Keeps baby right up at the table with you.",5
"Woombie Air Ventilated Baby Swaddle ~ Choose Size/Color (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Love Print)","The product is overall pretty good, but the mesh has two drawbacks.1. It's weak enough that it started to get &#34;runs&#34; on the first or second use. I'm afraid to use it and risk getting a hole.2. If your baby is active within the swaddle, the mesh could potentially cause a rug-burn type effect on their fingers.",3
Carry You Piccolo Small Stroller Snack Tray,I liked the caddy and found it to be good quality and a good price. I would recommend it. I used it on the front bar of our stroller for my son to store his hot wheels and sippy cup.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son it doing well with this seat, no little potty, staight to this seat.  The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over.  Fits on the toliet really snug",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,EXCELLENT......!!!!!!!!!,5
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"If you get out of the house at all, you should get this! Unless you just want to hold your baby in you lap while he grabs at your food and everything else you have within reaching distance!It was easy to use. I had no problem setting it up or taking it down. A friend saw me trying to figure out how to raise it (without reading the directions, haha) and showed me how, even though he had never seen one before. So I'd say most people should have no problem, especially if they read the directions.",5
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"Just to describe this a little better, it comes with seven toys to hang from the bars: a duck, a cardinal containing a bell perched on a ring with beads, a sunshine with dangling rattle, an apple teething toy filled with water so you can freeze it if you want, two plastic discs with photos of a puppy and a duckling, a mirror, and a star that plays music and lights up.  It comes with extra links so you can add some of your own toys, too, and there are hanging loops at the top, middle, and bottom of the bars.  The mat itself is brightly colored, has a satiny sort of finish, and is nicely padded and breathable.Issues:The mirror itself is plastic-y and curved a bit so the reflection is a bit distorted.  Doesn't seem to bother her in the least.The star's lights were a little frenetic for her with certain songs at first, but she loved it by 10 weeks old.The mat's fabric shows drool stains, but that doesn't bother me personally.The upshot:We love this toy.  Our daughter started with it when she was about 7 weeks old and was immediately delighted with it.  In the ensuing weeks we found that she would be interested in different parts of it at different times, but at 10 weeks she would happily lay under it for 30 minutes at a time... or more.  We rotate the hanging toys through and always take one with us when we go out.  In short, this is the one indispensable toy we own and I'd recommend it highly.",5
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,Everyone I gave it to said it was the best baby gift.,5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","Beautiful stroller, can't wait to see the little one in it!  It will be used so much, and with the carseat too!",5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","This seat fits almost every toilet, the grip handles allow your toddler to feel safe while jumping on and off the seat.  The deodorizing is not a big deal, as you would prefer to wash the seat from time to time instead of buying the re-fills.Overall is a great seat.  Highly recommended.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","The seat is Purple, not blue as appears in picture.  If you live in the south, this color choice is good bc it does NOT have the hot velour padding and material.  This one is the cool, smooth/sleek material.",5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Piece",I've had these for about 3 months now and they have held up really well. They're a good size. My daughter isn't feeding herself yet so I don't know how they will be with that but they seem like they would do well with scooping.,4
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","I purchased this sheet after being unable to find a mattress pad for my pac 'n play at a price I was willing to pay. This velour sheet is a good alternative, as it is thick enough to provide some cushioning over the hard pad in the pack 'n play. The Carter's velour sheet will work fine for my occasional use when I have a visiting grandchild. I wish it were available in other colors, as the sage is a pukey green, but, hey, I can live with a yucky color as long as the sheet functions as it should.",4
Fisher Price Soothe N Play Bouncer - Woodland Animals,My husband and I love this bouncer and so does our daughter. The colors work well with our modern decor and the toys are plastic (not fabric) so they don't get grimey and gross. They are also easy to clean when it's time.  She kicks and it really bounces - which she loves. The owl and mushroom are really appealing and so are the ways that the other animals flip around the bar. The bar itself can be removed easily but also acts as a handle for quick maneuvering.  So worth the cost.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We have had our Jumaparoo over a year now, it survived my son and a move. Now my daughter plays in it everyday!!!! Very durable!!! My nephew loves it as well!! I would recommend this to everyone! I have had no problems, it's safe, comfortable and really keeps the kids entertained. My daughter hates the walker but loves this!!! BUY IT",5
"Dora The Explorer Faucet Cover, Blue","States it fits ""most"" tub spouts, unfortunately it doesn't fit ours. Dora's head is also kinda wobbly, looks like it would fall off after much use.",1
Infantino Animal Park Shape Sorter,"While this doesn't talk or flash lights like some of the other shape sorter toys, she does really like to play with this one. It is easy for her to carry, which she wants to do with everything, and doesn't have too many pieces that it drives me crazy to find them all. Only complaint: the doors to the barn come off and I have to put them back on. It isn't a safety issue, but it is a tad bit annoying. However it is an enjoyable toy for her regardless.",4
Pumpin Pal Hands Free Strap,This took a very long time to set this up right for it to finally work. And when I had it working I was afraid to move at all because it felt like it would fall off. I wish I would have ordered the one with the bra attached to it instead. I would have returned it if I had kept the packaging and stuff it came with. I was too optimistic. Waste of money.,1
"Munchkin Swaddle Angel , Boy, Circle Print","After having tried 4 different kinds of swaddles, the Munchkin Swaddle has a few pros and cons for our newborn son.  Its light-weight fabric is great for warm weather climates, but it still needed to be hung up to dry after going through a tumble-dry low cycle.  I love being able to change his diaper without unswaddling his arms.  The large zipper and pull seem a little big and unnecessary, but compared to the Halo Sleep Sack, the diaper is more accessible without all the heavy fabric getting in the way.I was excited to try a swaddle that had pockets for the arms, but I had a hard time pulling the fabric tight enough so that my son's arm were secured.  He was able to pull his fist up to his mouth and suck on it through the material.  My husband was able to criss-cross his arms so that both fists were not near his mouth, but I don't like that he's sucking on the extra fabric still.  As with the SwaddleMe, there is too much material near the mouth even with his arms secured.  The Halo Sleep Sack has a better tapered cut so this doesn't happen.The Velcro pads need to be larger, especially on the right side.  We are not able to pull the left side as tightly as we would like.  The pad on the tummy doesn't allow the fabric to lay nicely when he is swaddled and there's a gap where the two fabrics meet.  You can see his clothes underneath and we have to keep tucking the fabric in. The angel wings decoration on the back is a really cute touch.  For the cost of this product, I would not buy it or recommend it.",3
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I really love my new pregnancy pillow. I am finally able to sleep comfortably through most of the night,minus the bathroom trips. It takes the pressure off my back and hips. I would recommend this product to all pregnant women.",5
Playmobil 5719 Nativity Set,"My son is 2 and loves this set. We took all the small parts away until later. I love that we can teach the true meaning of Christmas through play, and as usual the Playmobil piece are so detailed and durable. The scence itself is just cardboard.My only suggestion would me to make that plastic too and just charge more. This would be perfect for any child during the holidays. All the basics are there, the holy family, the wisemen,the manager, some animals, etc.",5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - Jungle,Love this ExerSaucer.  The only slight challenge is that the alligator is a litlle advanced for my daughter at 15 months.,4
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",My baby loves this. I keep it in the freezer for him so that when he is teething he can chew it and have the cool against his gums. It helps a lot,5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,our daughter uses it.  Nice and sturdy.  Not too soft.  She sleeps soundly through the night on it.  10 times better than the old one we had.,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","I've been using this pail liner for almost two years, in rotation with another liner (by Rumparooz), and though the fabric is still holding up, the sewing job on this thing is a joke. It's super simple, just a piece of fabric folded in two and stitched up each side with elastic on top. It's so simple, in fact, that any visit to a fabric store and five minutes with a sewing machine will yield the same result for less money. I've mended it a few times where it has opened. So, it's okay, but costly for what it is. The other pail liner I use was a few dollars more but it's very sturdy and the design is much better.",3
"Stork Craft Venetian 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry",This crib is absolutely beautiful. Even more so in person! The wood is of high quality and the machining and finish are top notch. VERY solid. Highly recommended!,5
"Stork Craft Portofino 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso","I know how hard it is to decide to purchase something as important as a crib online which is why I am compelled to write a review, knowing I read hundreds of them in the process and they all helped me greatly. This crib is a great buy and I'm glad we took the chance on purchasing it online. The price was reasonable and economical. The structure and color of the crib is very nice - visually stunning. The 3 drawers are spacious and we were able to get all clothes in there, divided by sizes. The 3 back shelves are great for storage for things you don't need to reach for every day - such as storage for spare diapers and wipes. It's hard to reach back there so I wouldn't recommend placing items you need every day. Overall we are very pleased with this purchase and would recommend.",5
Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"So far the mats are working perfectly.  I had some issues with other protective mats and the way they attached to the bottom of the seat, but these elastic bands seem to be the right solution.",5
"Clip'n Go Stroller Hook, Green by PBnJ baby","I have ordered 4 of these over the past few years.  They are fantastic when traveling with children and renting double strollers - like in Disney World!  I just clip them on the handles and can hang our shopping bags, coats, backpacks, anything!  Easy to open/close.I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because 2 of them have broke during use.  I do ask a lot of them, so I wasn't terribly upset, but the hinge could be a bit more durable.  So...get more than one! :)",4
Maclaren Volo Stroller,"Well, after reading great reviews on this stroller, I bought one, but I had to spend a great deal of time finding one volo of dark color, seat and hood especially, since when folded the hood touches the wheels.I have a few friends that got the volo on the white hood colors and they just get dirty and filty nasty, I don't have time to wash a stroller.  I don't know what the designing people of Maclaren where thinking when choosing such light colors, other than that the stroller works perfect and it is very light. So I ended up buying the brown coffee color from Baby Universe, not the coffee stripe, it is different.",2
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",I bought two of these for my twin daughters to use at lunch - I pack everyday for them to ensure they get a quality lunch and like to send hot lunches and these work great. Keeps their lunch hot and yummy 5 hours from the time I put it in the thermos and it is easy for them to open (which was a problem with the older ones they had) + the wide opening makes it easy for them to access the food. Very pleased with this purchase - thanks Amazon!,5
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragon",Dee Dee is adorable. I love her and my daughter does too! I have the princess and the moose too. All are equally adorable but each are a little different so it's fun to change them up. Easy to take with us and to play with at home. I would highly recommend the dragon!,5
"Mud Pie Baby Little Princess Sip N Munch, Crown","I love this product!  It is just beautiful and a perfect idea!  I wish there were more choices in colors and designs.  My only qualm is the straw is way too short at the top, my 7-8 month old loved it by now as she is 10 months old... it is just a little too short to take into her mouth and she tends to get frustrated at first.  If they made one with a larger straw I'd buy it for my 3 year old who would truely benefit from the little munch cup at the bottom.",4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"While I have asked questions pertinent to making this cup work in our house, I find myself more often than not wanting to throw it against a wall as it leaks incessantly, and pretty much are guaranteed instantaneously to start leaking as soon as the lid is on, it leaks form all sides as there doesnt appear to be a proper seal on the screw top and out of the straw. I have tried all the tips and tricks and with zero success on bettering this cup. However I have in fact come across a cup called ""Simba"" same straw technology better price point and that DOESN't spill or leak from anywhere there straw and screw top lid are designed slightly different and with that comes a wonderful user friendly cup that i have nothign but positive things to say about :-) So for all of you who find frustrations with this cup please look at ordering a SIMBA, its great!!",2
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Love this monitor! After much research before our little one was born we decided on this monitor because of price and simplicity! I can't say enough about their customer service! Our camera just quit one day and we contacted the company and had a new one sent to us within a couple days! Recently I dropped the handheld monitor and the antennae broke. I didn't give it much thought because it still worked. After about a week with no antennae it stopped working. I simply emailed the company and they sent me a whole new set before they even recieved my defective one! They are quick to respond and very knowledgeable! The monitor itself works great..I love the night vision and love being able to watch my little one as she sleeps! Highly recommend!  One downfall in my book...I do wish the monitor had constant sound, the sound cuts in and out only when the baby makes a noise. Totally fine but, I like to hear everything!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub Deluxe,Our 6-month-old loves the tub!  It is convenient for us and saves water.  Right now he stays occupied with the build-in squeaky toy while we wash him clean.  It fits nicely and seems to be pretty sturdy and well made.,5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"Milkies Milk saver is a great product for all nursing mothers. I only purchase one because it's pretty pricey. I place it on one side of my breast when I breastfeed the other side. I can't believe how much milk I've been wasted during feeding. I put the milk that was collected in the bottle and feed my baby later. It's easy to clean and store away in its storage(also included). The only down side is a little too big to wear it outdoor. The size of it is very noticeable. Other than that, it's a wonderful product. I also purchase this milkies milk saver for my friend as a baby shower gift. She loves it. I highly recommend this item to all the nursing mothers.",4
"OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Green","I only spent about two days looking for a baby food freezer tray, but when I got the discount email for baby items at Amazon I wasn't expecting to find the perfect freezer tray. And I did! It keeps the food well, good size, food pops out easily and I love the fact I can pop out one or two little cubes and put the remaining back in the freezer. Cleans nicely and while I only have one, I like the fact it would stack well if I bought multiples. We have a small freezer.",4
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Pretty simple to assemble, I love that it has as nice toy tray.My son didn't really start to like this product till about 6 months of age, he can sit in it for a good 20 minutes and be easily entertained with the different toys.I really like this product, its a bit different from all of the other bouncers,swings, and infant activity items out there.UPDATE:My son is now 9mo and still uses this seat, it does manage to amuse him, however now he is more interested in reaching his feet under the front of the tray.Its also very convenient to take to grandma's house or to put my kiddo in it, in the kitchen while I get something done.",5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I am so crazy about the Ergo Baby. It is so comfortable and easy to use, not to mention extremely well made and customize-able.The straps around the hips and shoulders are well padded and distribute the baby's weight perfectly.I use it for both my three year daughter and my 4 month old son. My 4 month old can ride all day in it and never gets fussy. He naps comfortably, and can breast feed discreetly, thanks to the button-up hood in the front.There is a world of difference in the quality and construction of this product versus other baby carriers on the market. Where some feel flimsy and unsafe to hold even a newborn, I feel confident and secure even hauling around my toddler in it.I would highly recommend this product to any parent who has children up to 5 years of age.",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Healthy Care Booster,"We owned an earlier model of this booster seat. I bought it about 5 years ago. It took us through 2 children. The model we had came with two removable trays. When the top tray got messy, we removed it and continued with the second tray.Because we had a high chair, it was not used constantly. It was easy to take places that didn't have high chairs such as when we visited with relatives who did not have children. You can take it on picnics or to restaurants. A few times I put it on the porch while the older child played with bubbles. The chair made the experience worry free. The children were not left alone, but it was easier to play with both children instead of having to constantly watch/pull the little back from the edge of the porch.When I gave it away recently, the plastic still looked good. To clean the straps which I could not remove, I used Shout towelette wipes. It looked almost new.I liked the colors on the older version better. The back was red with a blue seat. The trays were green and yellow.I highly recommend this booster chair.  It is light yet sturdy.  It is easy to clean and use.",5
"Booginhead Pacigrip, Nautical Red",These are a must have and more than one. I bought the red and blue ones. Infatuated with nautical right now so they match all of my son's outfits,4
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue",The product itself is good. Decent price but the only problem for me is how it fits. If your drain has a nob that sticks up above the seal part it will not work. Otherwise great product for seal stopper.,3

Tiny Love Musical Take Along Arch - Ocean,"This is the only thing my son will coo and smile at on his carseat!  It hooked just fine to my infant seat.  The musical crab plays music when you shake it.  Even going over a bump in the road will activate it.  When it plays, my son will smile at it.  I love this toy.  It makes riding in the car enjoyable.",5
Mobi Glomate Junior,We love this product.  My toddler uses it for bed time and it is so wonderful.  After 15 minutes it shuts off so no worries about making sure to turn it off.  Highly reccommended.,5
"Tiny Love Tummy Time Fun Activity Mat, Frog","Pros:- nice, vibrant colour- pillow is good size for wedging baby in sitting position as alternate use- mirror is good (image is not distorted like some other toy mirror), and my baby loves to chew the mirrorCons:- unlike those gym with activity cross bars, this is just a tummy mat, and nothing more, so I think it wasn't a smart purchase- the mat is quite small so it's no longer in use after a couple months- after a few washes the mat is a bit wrinkled, it wasn't too bad, but not as flat as new- pillow material is not as smooth and soft as I'd like it to be",3
Baby Crawling Knee Pad Toddler Elbow Pads Pink,It looks nice but it's too tight for my baby girl. They should make it in diferent sizes to fit all kinds of babies.,1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","We used to have one of the star-projecting ladybugs in the room with our little kids, but the batteries would die relatively quickly. This plug-in projector has been great. The kids love the three different projection slides you can put in, and the choice of music and adjustability in time and sound level work well. This is a great choice for the nursery -- you won't regret it.",5
Sassy MyPhone,"I like that this makes sounds when you press the different colorful buttons. Perfect for an infants developmental skills. But the sound is way to low. We am hardly hear it, unless the room is silent.",3
Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"I so wanted to love this travel crib, but I just can't. After copious amount of research I purchased the Lotus (at the hefty $200 price point) for a trip to visit family alone with my 8-month-old that involved flying. This thing seemed like the perfect solution since it was compact enough to fit in an overhead storage bin. The compact size is the ONLY thing I ended up liking about it. Below are my major disappointments and reasons I am selling it after about 4 months of use:- velcro straps take forever to thread through the base to secure the mattress and sheet (all while hunched over at a very uncomfortable angle since you have to have one arm in and one are out of the crib to do it).- the mattress DOES NOT LIE FLAT once the sheet is over it. It pulls the mattress to a point that baby has to lie on it (uncomfortably I'm sure) to flatten it out, and even then it still pulls up on the ends. I have no idea how they got it to lie flat with the sheet on it in the product picture. Mine will not do this.I find myself envious of my friends' bulkier pack 'n plays because they are SOOO much easier to assemble and take apart and their babies look so much more comfortable in them. For the $200 price tag, the lotus should have a more efficient assembly and the mattress should lie flat!!",2
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Loves to play with the buttons and lightit comes on automatically if it hears a soundand it can be set to turn off in 15, 30, or and hour intervals.it will Not run Forever... The first one we had brokeand this one is now starting to fail.  But it's worth the $$for a good nights sleep.",3

"Hudson Baby Striped Chenille Blanket, Pink","This blanket is extremely soft not too big when he carry's it doesn't drag he is about average 21month old but when he goes to cuddle up and lay down covers pretty much his body, blanket tag says 30x40 its the first thing he grabs at night to go to sleep and when he wants to nurse. nice material so far no problems and he is in love and I get my sleep back,",5
"NUK Gerber Graduates Baby Food Pouch Feeding Straw, 6 Months Plus, 2-Count",My son plays with all his packets and it just ends up in a mess and waste of money.  This prevents him from squirting it everywhere and he actually eats them now.  YAY!,4
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,We installed this perfectly as instructed and it came off within a day. I wanted it to work so bad I didn't listen to all the other reviewers...baaaaad!,1
"Lamaze Developmental Toy, Flip Flop Fred",Or I should that my grandaughter loves it. The only gripe that I have is that product dimensions on your web are incorrect. The toy is listed as being  24 x 10 x 6 inches. Its real size is 4.5 dia. x 2 inches high.  I'm still looking for the big box.,5
"Wupzey Highchair Seat Cover, Orange Dot","I bought this on a whim for my expensive Chicco highchair b/c buying a replacement pad directly from their corporate office was too much of a headache.  I LOVE IT!!  Easy to slip over the current cover, washable, cute to look at...what else can you ask for!!  Great purchase!!",5
Peg Perego Uno Travel System,"The stroller is a snap. It has all the features of the top end strollers for a fraction of the price. A bonus is that you can move the handle bar from one side to the other, which is great to use it as a pram and then later for when your child is older. The car seat is an easy install; the only downside is it is a little heavy, but by the time that that is an issue you will be leaving the car seat in the car anyways. It is also very aesthetically pleasing.",5
"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","Comfortable chair, easy to strap baby in. A little difficult to adjust the straps to make them higherEasy to install chair into chair",3
"Fridababy The Windi Gas and Colic Relief,  10-Count","I was at my wits end and ordered this, not really even in my right mind. I thought it was funny and I needed some comic relief. It is life changing. Happy baby, happy life.",5
ERGObaby Organic Sucking Pad Pair,I would recommend this sucking pads.  My son kept on sucking on the straps and I had to wash the carrier all the time.  I started using the sucking pads and now I only have to wash the pads...i still wash the carrier but not every time I use it.  The picture is a little different from the product as my sucking pads came with 3 snaps instead of velcro.,5
"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","The crib is beautiful, but we bought it to match my daughter's dark cherry crib purchased Target 2 years ago.  The crib that we were sent is a walnut color (no hint of red at all).  There were also a couple small areas where the finish was chipped off (side rails near where it meets the back rail).  The box was in good shape when it arrived though so I do not think it was a problem with the packaging/shipping. We will end up keeping it though.  Also Delta made a couple of improvements to the crib that don't match our other crib.  The mattress support is  a metal frame with springs which seems better than the metal rods our daughter's mattress rests on.  Also when we do convert it to a toddler bed there will just be one side piece slightly longer than the one on our old crib (also an improvement).",4
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","We purchased this seat after reading tons of reviews and doing a bunch of research.  It was super easy to install. Our daughter is 1 year old, 21 lbs and 30 inches tall.  She just out grew the Peg Perego Infant seat.  The car seat is in a Landrover LR4, which has a short backseat, this seat fits in it with enough room so that I, as the driver, still have room to put my seat back.She seems just as comfortable in this seat as in the last Perego.  The wings allow her to see out the window while rear facing and still keep her safe.",5
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","I love the backpack and even my child loves to be in it, which is amazing.  Very good support and easy to use.",5
Graco Jump N Jive Doorway Jumper with Interactive Musical Mat,"Really well made, excellent back support, lots of safety features.  Not all babies like to kick and jump, but if yours does, this Doorway Jumper is a guaranteed winner.  Just be sure your doorway is really oversized, because with enough energy and jumping, you don't want to take a chance of it bumping into the door frame.  The mat is kind of fun.....different sounds when the baby jumps on different areas.  The song might drive YOU crazy, but our 6 month old never seems to get tired of it.  A word of caution.....this is really well made, but the leg holes are kind of large.  Just be sure not to let the little one be in this without supervision...",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"I started researching PNP Mattresses after my sons's two month check up and he was already 11 lbs. I read so many reviews and was hesitant to make ANY purchase!Everyone kept commenting that the mattress was too hard and not comfortable, but I had to get something. I finally chose the Dream on Me 3&#34; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress and I couldn't be happier.It is NOT hard at all. It is has the right amount of give, but is solid enough to not worry about him at night. It also fit perfectly in the Graco Pasadena Pack N Play Link Here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y9AKZI/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)I have an organic fitted sheet on it that also fits great.It doesn't have the plastic/fake feeling that other baby/toddler mattresses have either. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that is using a PNP as a crib.",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","My son was so excited when he got this. He's only 1 1/2 years old but loves to sit and climb on it. The rocking part of it is kind of lame though. Due to the chair being so lightweight, if you choose to put the rockers on the bottom the chair will slide around pretty easily making it difficult (And dangerous) for your little one to climb on it.",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","My wife an I have the B Nimble Britax stroller and it folds up fine when the strollers folded for storage or to throw in the back of the suv for shopping ventures.  Velcro straps hold it onto the metal handles by the handle bars and it has yet to come off, been on it for 8 months or so without issues.  The magnetic center part is nice for keys and small items, not galaxy S4s but small HTC cellphones fit it.  Cup holders are regular sized fit can and cups but not big gulps lol.  Does what its supposed to do, works and looks nice.",5
"Arm's Reach Concepts Mini Convertible Arc Co-Sleeper Bedside Bassinet, Cocoa/Natural","OK, let's talk about the good things about this co-sleeper:--it is relatively cute--built to allow you close access to your sleeping baby.On the other hand:--it was hard to put together (and this is after a veritable parade of baby assembly projects, including multiple things from IKEA and a pram and a dresser).  the directions could have been a lot clearer.--the warning labels are printed on the bed directly, and say the word DEATH over and over.  i am not super superstitious, but neither am i thrilled to have the word DEATH written seven times on my newborn's new bed.--it is too low to the ground (unless you have some really low-lying bed, like a futon maybe).  so you have to buy ""leg extenders,"" which arm's reach would like to sell you for $18~, and theirs look really flimsy and unsafe.  i bought extenders from a different company.--the ""mattress"" inside it is hard as a rock and has lumps and grooves in it.  arm's reach would like to sell you an organic mattress replacement for $119.99.  i bought a pad for the mattress (B008VVWP8A, costs $99) only to discover that my new mattress covered up the co-sleeper's two inches of mesh, which are there at the base of the bed to keep your baby from suffocating once they can roll over.i guess i am going to use the co-sleeper with the latex pad until the baby can roll over, and then i'll have to figure out a new solution.  but i am pretty emphatically dissatisfied.  i feel like i bought a car only to discover that the seats and the steering wheel had to be ordered extra.  this $175 cosleeper might be more like a $315 cosleeper once all is said and done.",2
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I love this pillow.  It provides exactly the right support and I sleep comfortably through the night.  I wish I knew about this when I was pregnant with my first child.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru, Bronze",We have had this gate up for 8 months to keep the animals out of our new living room & it works great.  I love that it can easily be taken down if needed to clean or have more space to get through entry way.  I am going to order another one for our office.  It has held up great & we get compliments on how nice it is & blends in instead of looking like a gate.  Have had several people ask where we purchased it.,5
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog",It's adorable and I love it I've owned it for about a month and I'm in my third set of batteries. I regret buying this. Seriously.,1
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,I've been very pleased with this drying rack.  I received this as a gift when my first daughter was born in 2010.  It's been on my counter ever since.  We are long past the bottle stage but it still works well for the sippy cups and kids silverware. It has held up nicely.  It would make a nice shower gift for a new mom.,5
"Eric Carle Back Seat Baby View Mirror, Elephant","I love the Eric Carle theme so of course I wanted the car seat mirror!  The elephant is adorable and the straps that attach this to the back of the seat are well made and there are no issues at all with it falling or with poor placement.My issues with this product is that the mirror isn't any good. First it comes with a sticker on it that if you don't get lucky removing leaves a film that is impossible to get off. Second, the mirror just isn't that good, it's difficult to see in because it has a distortion. I consider it to be a driving hazard because it will cause you to keep your eyes off the road for too long in order to see what your baby is doing.If you need to see your baby, and I know that sometimes we do.. then I advise you to get a better mirror or simply pull over and assess your child's needs. No good will come out of getting into an accident because you're focused on trying to see into a mirror that isn't really a mirror.",2
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","One half of the internal mechanism that opens/closes when you step on the pedal broke - the plastic pivot point sheared off under regular use.  We weren't rough with it - it's just cheaply constructed and didn't last.I'm planning to buy a regular step trash can instead, which will be more reliable, and use regular garbage bags.",1
Summer Infant 3-Stage Super Seat,Got this for my 4 month old daughter. It was easy to put together. It did smell like plastic when I opened it but the smell went away after a day. I like that the tray is so big because I can put other toys on it for her without them falling on the ground.,4
"Kids Preferred Lion King Plush Toy, Nala","I used this as part of center pieces for my daughter's baby shower - great plush quality.  A little on the pricey side, but the quality was good; i got what i paid for; that's for sure.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I've been using it on my baby since it was three weeks old and with the use of the snaps it fits just right. Baby is now almost two months and it still works great. The gussets on the legs are great at preventing leaks, pee or poop, have not had any problems. Highly recommend.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest",Our grandson loves this highchair. He keeps busy with the toys while his Momma cooks supper and he can watch her also. It doesnt take up as much space as a full sized high chair. They love it.,5
My Little Pony Drink Bottle,I bought this for my daughter but decided to keep it.  Does this make me a bad father?  Don't judge me.,5
"Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Multiview Handheld Color Video Monitor, Grey","I had purchased and returned several different monitors before this one because each one had a flaw I couldn't live with.  This was the first monitor I could find that had the capacity for muliple cameras and didn't automatically go into the ""sleep"" mode (essentially turning off until it hears a loud sound. I hated that!)  I like the autoscan mode that goes between cameras every few seconds the best.  The sounds stays on the entire time and is very sensitive.  This is exactly what I wanted as I like to hear my children breathing.  The color and picture quality is not the best, but that's okay with me... I can still see the kids just fine.  Also, the screen is a little small, so when it splits into 4 boxes for the multi-view mode, the boxes are only about an inch in size.  And maybe my husband and I just can't figure it out, but the sound seems to turn off in multi-view mode too.  So there is a little room for improvement, but overall, I am extremely happy with this product and would definately recommend it to anyone who wants to use multiple cameras with their video monitor.",4
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","Bought this to help my 6 month old stop frequently waking whenever hearing the dogs barking, noise at night to get her to take longer naps and eventually sleep through the night. Well, she doesn't sleep through the night, but her naps went from 45 mins to an hour and a half! The dogs barking at the UPS man doesn't wake her up anymore. I can vacuum around the house when she sleeps, do dishes and carrying on a normal level of sound. Prior to this machine, I could not do that. We use the white noise for sleeping and play the music when she plays in her crib. Sound quality is nice. I haven't tried the Mp3 cable yet. I also like the night light for at night when I go in to soothe her I don't have to turn any lights on, just tap the top of the sound machine.",5
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I am using these diaper pants as underwear covers and they work great. My daughter recently started potty training and the covers have kept in 100% of the mess with the few accidents that she has had. Having to clean up less of a mess and protecting our furniture at the same time has been great! The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because the leg holes are a bit too small, but we have made them work.",4
"Gerber First Essential Clear View BPA Free Plastic Nurser With Latex Nipple, 9 Ounce, Single Pack",I always like to stock up on bottles for my granddaughter so i purchased a few of these great bottles for the price.,5
"Luvable Friends 5-in-1 Soft Baby Carrier, Black, 3-18 Months",this carrier is the best you'll ever find with all it's different positions u can carry ur baby most carriers only carry your baby front or back this carrier has a side carry position which is wonderful because with my other carrier i had my baby face outwards in my front but he would still be in the way with this carrier i had my baby sideways like i was carrying him in my arms but HANDS FREE... LOVE THIS PRODUCT ALOT,5
Oxo Tot Bath Toy Bin,"I live in an older home with some strange textured walls and surfaces around the bathtub, we attempted to attach this to the smoothest surface we could find but it just didn't hold. There was no replacement adhesive so we got creative and attached it to the same wall with command strips and it has stayed put for over a week  now. I use this for the small bath toys that my toddler has in the bathroom, since this allows the water to drain off I think it is much better than the bucket we were using previously.",4
Blueberry Deluxe Laundry Bag Tote,"It is cute and I really like the strap.  I just wish it was a little bigger.  It says 8 diapers, I disagree.  I can only put a max of 6 diapers in it.  Otherwise than that I have had no problems with it. Holds smell well and makes cloth diapering on the go much easier.  I've been using it for over a month now.",4
New Pink Minky Dot Chenille Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,Comforter set is cheaply made with thin fabrics.  The added extras are thrown in to make it appear that you're getting more for your money than you actually are.  I returned the set and was charged a 15% restocking fee.,2
Bamboobino Baby Washcloths / Wipes - 5-pack,Not as nice as I was expecting.  Will know more after baby momma washes and uses them. Maybe she can comment on them.,3
Bright Starts Petal Pusher Carrier Toy Bar,when my baby isn't sleeping in the car she loves playing with her toys. I am glad I got it for her.,5
Baby Home Emotion Stroller - Blue,I am so glad that I got this stroller. It was very easy to assemble and the directions were really easy to follow. It's lightweight and folds up for easy portability and storage. It rolls very smoothly which some other strollers I tested did not roll near as smoothly as this. It comes in a variety of colors and priced just right. It almost fully reclines which is great. It comes with a pretty large sunshade/waterproof canopy so your baby doesn't get burned and the sun isn't in their face. It has a pretty large shopping basket (larger than others that I looked at) to put diaper bag and pocket book in. It includes a rain cover and mosquito net which most other companies will make you purchase these seperately. I had looked at a lot of different strollers before turning to this one. For the price you cannot beat it.,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count",would love to be able to give 0 stars. These are horrible. They leak really easily. I also bought the Charlie Banana and as the saying goes you get what you pay for. I love the Charlie Banana. They cost a little more but are well worth the money.,1
"Label Itz Bandette Cup and Bottle Labels, Zoo Animals","I thought these would be wonderful for daycare, where we are required to have our son's name and date on every bottle.  The packaging said that with a pen, information is easy to &#34;erase&#34;.  I did not find that to be the case.  After using them once, the date will not come off.  I tried to write his name over it, but it doesn't look great.  If I had known, I would have just put his name and been done with it, but I now have 6 of these and it drives me nuts that I can still see the date from March!",3
Ken Health - Mini Medicator - Baby Medicine Dispenser/Pacifier with Free Syringe,"Our infant loves this, and we frequently use it for gripe water dispensing.  We ordered a second one just to have another handy, but the seller Good Life Products shipped a different, inferior model.  Going through their exchange process now.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Wrap &amp; Roll Infant Carrier Arm Pad &amp; Tummy Time Mat, Social Circle Blue",I love this wrap for my car seat! I have unrolled it and used the mat for my baby as well. I would definitely buy this as a gift for friends when they have babies.,5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila",I am pleased with this car seat except for 1 issue...The arm rests do not go high enough for older children. They have two settings and even on the highest setting the seat belt is hard to get under the armrest and over my daughters legs. Other than that it is easy to take the back rest off and adjustable for head height.,4
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","We bought this a couple of years ago to use for travel, but we ended up using it daily for over a year.Pros: compact, easy to set up, comfortable, inexpensiveCons: When used daily it's difficult to clean out crumbs and food that's become caught in the velcro and the material folds. For this reason, we recently bought a hard plastic booster, but we'll still use this for trips.",4
"Munchkin 4 Pack Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cups, 10 Ounce",These cups are ok.  The straw design is funny and makes deep cleaning difficult.  Getting the straw back in after removal for cleaning is a puzzle.  They work reasonably well and don't spill much.  They do tend to splash liquid out when you open the straw with liquid in the bottle.,3
"BayB Brand Bean Bag for Babies - Filled, Ready to Use - Ships in 24 Hours! (Blue/Blue)",Just received this bean bag a few days ago and my 1-year-old seems to enjoy it. He's comfortable and secure!,5

"Personalized My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children By Pockets of Learning",Excellent customer service! They were very helpful. The book itself is very cute. A couple things were sewn on crocked bit it's a great gift for a little one,4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","This toy is awesome!It attaches to almost anything!  I love the versatility.  We have attached it to a swing, a carseat, a highchair, a bouncer, a changing table...its really neat.My baby is fairly young to &#34;play&#34; with the toys, so I can't rate those yet, but once he gets a little bigger I see him enjoying this even more.Innovative toy, worth the $",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","so far this cot is perfect, it is for my granddaughter to use while holiday company is using her room.  it arrived quickly, and is more than a fair price for it's instant setup and sturdy base.  my 5 yr old granddaughter can set it up and fold it down to slide into it's storage case in the mornings all by herself.",5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"We have been using these diapers since our son was born.  He is now nearly 2 years old and they still fit him as well as they always have.  Initially, the diaper is a bit bulky because the fabric bunches with all of the snaps, but as your child grows the diaper becomes less bulky.  When we decided to cloth diaper, I was aware that they aren't typically the slimmest of options, so a little extra bulk didn't bother me.The inserts are absorbent and I like that you can double up for nights and nap time to help avoid leaks.I love all of the colors available!I certainly recommend the snap closure over the velco.  We had a few velco one sizers and the velco wore out after a year.  Our snaps are in great shape and I look forward to being able to use them for baby #2 someday.",5
"Gro-Egg Color Changing Digital Room Thermometer, White","The gro egg was a spontaneous purchase - so it was sort of gamble on our end to get it. We've spent the last couple of weeks adjusting to a cooler temperature in our apartment!  I actually really like it - you know if the temp is right by the color of the egg and it makes a nice nightlight too. Also, we weren't aware that the room temp needs to be at a much lower temperature for baby - so it's nice a visual cue to make sure baby's room (and really our apt) is on target. We have another digital thermometer in another room close by and the temps are in sync. I would give this egg 5 stars if they had the time on their too. With that said, I'd recommend this product to others.",4
"JJ Cole Swag Diaper Bag, Bronze Drop","I love this bag because it doesn't look too much like a diaper bag. Only the size of it gives it away. I really like the design, it fits everything I need. My little one likes pulling things out of the outside pockets so it keeps him occupied. And the outside zippered pocket is big enough for me to put just about everything from my purse in (and the little one can't get in it.) It had one flaw on the gold part(in the fabric)of it but you dont really notice it. Overall I think its a fabulous diaper bag.",4
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This is a great little music player. It has an off switch (always important), a low volume and a louder volume. The music is all instrumental with no strange or annoying voices singing.  The classical music is all upbeat and my 16 month old loves it. He dances to any music--even commercials and TV programs.  He loves being able to carry this around.",5
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I have a seven year old still in diapers at night...for many reasons. With the cost of it all I wondered how cloth would be and I am happy to report that these diapers are wonderful. The weight requirements say up to 40 lb., (he is 60 lbs.) but my son is thin, so I was took a gamble, and they work great! And so much cheaper. I am grateful for this bigger cloth diaper.",5
One Dozen (12) Rubber Duckie Ducky Duck Christmas Nativity Scene,"This nativity scene is exactly what I expected--absolutely darling, whimsical and perfect for the collector.  The price was right too.",5
Babies R Us Washcloth - 8 Pack (White),"I am usually a 100% cotton, organic if possible Mum.  However my husband bought these cloths for bath time not realising they had 20% polyester in them.  I didn't like them at first but have since changed my mind.  I like to use a fresh cloth ever time I wash and bath my son. We go through maybe 5 a day, sticky faces and hands. This means I need a lot of cloths.  They have turned out to be a great size, big enough for me to wash him with and small enough for him to deal with. He now likes to have a go at washing himself and are easy for him to hold onto and squeeze some of the excess water out of.  A normal sized flannel is just too much material for them to handle.  They are soft on his skin, wash fab on a hot wash and tumble dry great.  They are nice and cheap so it doesn't break then bank to have a whole heap of them.  So far I have't had to throw any out because of fraying etc and they have been in use for about a year.  Very pleased with them 5 Star!!!!",5
Multi-Purpose Lock - Clear/Silver 6 Pack,"This product is great for securing refrigerator doors, and other appliances or doors. It fastens easily and withstands strong toddler hands trying to pry it open. It is a bit difficult to close, but I like that I can leave it open if I choose to and don't have to wrestle within every time a cabinet, or door closes.",4
"Sealy Sweet Pea 2-in-1 Maternity and Nursing Pillow, Cappuccino","I bought this pillow when I was 4 months pregnant hoping it would provide support. I would wake up with severe round ligament pain within 30 mins due to the lack of support and being unable to position it. I still decided not to return it as I thought that maybe I had bought the pillow too early since the woman in the picture looks farther along in her pregnancy. I am now 8 months pregnant (with a huge belly!) and I pulled the pillow out again last night to use and woke up again with the same round ligament pain due to lack of support. I have tried to ""mount"" and position this thing in every way possible and can't get comfortable. I am 5'4 and yet this pillow is also no where long enough for me to get the hip support as showed in this picture.Every other pillow in my house provides more support than this one does. My only hope is that I can use it for breast feeding but if it's too hard for me, I can only imagine how uncomfortable it will be for a newborn. Maybe mine was defective because the picture shows that the pillow is more narrow at one end (by the head). If I look at mine.... it's the same width at both sides.I should have returned it months ago. :-(",1
"Baby Crib Mirror - Black, White &amp; Red- Infant-Stim",Useful for my baby - big and not breakable which is a major plus :) I like the ties.. can tie them to various things...but my baby seems to  be losing interest in looking at herself in the mirror now,4
Baby Home Emotion Stroller - Blue,"I love love love this stroller, let me count the ways:1. Super light weight for a fully featured stroller!2. REALLY compact fold, heck it fits into my scion xb trunk which is how I found this stroller in the first place. Saves me such precious cargo space.3. Stylish - it is one of a kind!4. SUPER easy fold but requires two hands.5. HUGE storage basket that you can actually use.6. Adjustable footrest and the back EASILY reclines.7. Smooth ride with ONE hand. Yes, I could not believe it. Those skateboarding wheels are the trick.8. Comfy - she loves it and that's huge!9. Magnetic peakaboo window!10. Ships with mosquito net and rain cover!The ways that I could love thee more:1. Seat folds outwards so I always have the wheels of my stroller facing out in my car so it doesn't get the seat dirty.2. Canopy not huge but you can buy an extender or an attachable umbrella that can basically follow the sun and give coverage at any angle.3. No cupholder included (cmon!!!) but you can buy one as an accessory.I also own a first ignite umbrella stroller (too long for my XB. I have to get everything out before i can use it). We also own an orbit stroller that I love but once again takes out too much space in this car's trunk, so we leave it in the other car. Another huge downside of the orbit is that you have to remove the seat before you can close the stroller. So yes, good question, where do you put the seat while you fold the stroller?? Lastly, we have a hand-me-down BOB revolution that is fantastic when we go on the trailer but when that beast gets into our trunk, nothing else does. So it pretty much stays in the garage. Babyhome emotion is my everyday stroller.",5
"Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifier, Girls, Stage 2,  6-12 Months",Really love these. They came in a timely manner and i like how the nipple has the hollowed out portion.  It may make it easier to get rid of her pacifiers.,5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - Farmyard,"Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - FarmyardThe paint on the sheep and pig toys immediately began chipping off as soon as I bought this item.  Of course, my son puts both toys in his mouth, so he ended up eating the paint.  I had to take both toys off the exersaucer, and replace them with different ones.",2
Fisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Dual Receiver Monitor,"This is a great monitor.  I am able to keep one receiver plugged in on my night stand and the other receiver is plugged in on the ground floor of my house, with batteries so I can take it around with me.  Having two receivers means never having to look for it before going to bed - one is always there!The range is great I've been able to hear my daughter clearly outside at my mailbox (about 50 yrds away).  The batteries last a really long time, and even when they are low the audio works long after the lights fade from lack of power so you can still know what is going on while looking for replacements.I've never had any ""bleed over"" from phones or other monitors in the neighborhood.  One problem I've had is during the summer I pick up a sports radio broadcast, but if I just turn the volume down a litle I can't hear the broadcast but I can still clearly hear my daughter.This monitor has worked great for 2 years and I'm hoping to buy a second set for the new baby so my toddler can still have a monitor in her room.",4
"Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","***EDITED AGAIN 5/14/12***And now the chair is kaput. I was rocking my now-almost-2-year-old as part of our bedtime routine and suddenly there was a crashing/cracking noise and we dropped an inch or two. I figured one of the bolts had fallen out (it's happened before) but one of the bearings had been ripped away from the chair, leaving damage to the wood. It might be fixable, but honestly, I'm sick of replacing screws and bolts when they fall out and constantly tightening and WD-40ing this thing to keep it in working order. I really wanted this chair to be a good cheaper alternative to a more expensive rocker and it just didn't work out. :( Probably going to put it out to the curb tomorrow and go buy a recliner. So disappointed to be tossing the chair I've been rocking my little one to sleep in every night for the better part of two years!***EDITED 10/3/11****Well, we've had the glider for the better part of a year now, and sadly, it has not held up. It is now squeaking constantly no matter how much we tighten and WD-40. We still rock our 14-month-old nightly as part of our bedtime routine, and it's now annoying and feels kind of rickety. Unfortunately, the quality has just not stood the test of time. I'm really sorry to say that, because I wanted to love this chair and it is very comfortable to sit in. Our Shermag, which also gets daily use, works as well as it did the day we got it. If anything, I think the rocking motion has gotten smoother on it over time. I mentioned in the original review that I thought the Shermag would outlast the Stork Craft, but I didn't think the SC would poop out THIS soon! The SC would be a great rocker for grandma's house, but if you plan on rocking for more than a few months, this one is a waste of money, sorry to say. You're better off investing in a good one up front.*****We already have a $300 Shermag rocker that we use in our nursery, and we got the Stork Craft Tuscany Glider/Ottoman when we wanted a 2nd chair but had less of a budget. Here are the main differences:--- The Shermag is noticeably ""plusher"". The cushions are much, much softer. The Stork Craft has a pretty crunchy foam seat that needed to be broken in (not a lengthy process -- I kneeled on the cushion a few times before putting it on the seat). If, like me, you appreciate a firm cushion, you won't think this is a problem. Both chairs are attractive, and the quality of the Stork Craft fabric is nicer than I expected for the price point.--- The Shermag is heavier and sturdier. I would be surprised if it didn't outlast the Stork Craft. (Hey, you get what you pay for!)--- The Stork Craft was MUCH easier to assemble. Many fewer steps as the ottoman and bottom part of the chair (the glider) were fully assembled in box. My only complaint re: the assembly is that a hole was not drilled where it should have been to connect the left arm of the chair to the base. Each arm attaches in three places, and I found it to be sturdy enough without the third bolt that I didn't bother returning it. Next time my dad is over, I'll have him bring his drill and fix it for me ... no biggie. In the meantime, the arm doesn't wiggle with regular use.--- Yes, the Stork Craft squeaks. It squeaks loudly enough to render it completely unusable. My dog actually came running in from the other room the first time I used it and started barking at the chair because she thought it was an animal, ha! The squeaking comes from the bolts on the glider part of the chair. I sprayed some WD-40 on the joints, and voila! No squeaking. If anything, I would say the gliding motion is now smoother than my Shermag.--- The seats are different sizes. Once you have all the cushions and padding on, the Stork Craft seat is 18 inches across at the armrests and 17 inches deep, vs. the Shermag's 20 inches across and 20 inches deep. The back of the seat is longer on the Stork Craft -- 28 inches vs. 26. I am short and slightly overweight (5'4 with a long torso/short legs, size 14) and the Stork Craft fits me much better. However, I am sure the Shermag would be much more comfortable for a tall/long-legged woman, an average man, or someone more heavyset.--- The Shermag has a lever to lock the chair in place, which I need on that chair to stand up smoothly while holding a sleeping baby since I have to scoot forward before I can touch the floor. The Stork Craft doesn't have the locking mechanism, and I thought I would miss it; but since the seat actually fits my legs, I have no problem getting in and out of the chair gracefully. (And believe me, that's a feat!)Overall, yes, the quality is obviously nicer on a more expensive chair. But the only dealbreaker for me was the squeaking, and it was an easy, $5 fix. If you are petite and looking for a nice, inexpensive rocker, this will definitely suit your needs! If you are tall/heavyset, you will definitely need to invest in a different chair.",1
dreamgenii Pregnancy Body Support and Feeding Pillow (UPDATED),"This pillow is great because it provides just the right amount of support without taking up the whole bed. I sleep on it different ways depending on how I am feeling - sometimes I use the back support for my belly and pull the bottom part of the other side up through my legs. I also flip it over when I change sides, which is easy to do. It has completely stopped all of the hip pain I was feeling sleeping on my side. I would definitely recommend this pillow, even for those who are not pregnant but need support!",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I bought this for my toy poodle because she runs all over the backyard when she's supposed to be taking care of her business. This play yard along with treats has totally house trained her. And I know she is safe.,5
"Safari Evergreen Jungle Tree Wall Decals, Jungle Stickers with Green Leaves and Vinyl Tree","Love these decals!! These are heavy duty-type decals and they look really nice on the wall. The whole set is very large, so make sure you have enough wall space. I got the teal colored set for my baby boy's room, and it's nicely colored, however, a little feminine looking-but that's probably my fault for choosing teal. I omitted putting the flowers and butterflies on the wall that came with the mini teal-colored animal set that I purchased too, that was definitely too girly. I didn't have many problems applying the decals, but I can now recommend to overlap the decals a little when attaching the branches to the trunk. I tried to fit mine on without overlapping, just perfectly next to each other, and the next day there were small spaces of wall I could see in between, and I had to remove the trunk part and redo. But everything re-stuck, and it looks great!!",5
Eco Sprout Bottom Balm+ (2oz),"My friend from Texas told me to try it, though I couldn't find it in any stores in my Washington State neighborhood.  I've used gdiaper cloth diapers for a year now and I was just using coconut oil on my little girl but I wanted something more protective.  I saw that this could be used with cloth diapers and it was all natural so I thought I would give it a try.  I love the smell and it seems to keep my girls bottom free of rash so far, I think I've been using it a couple months.",5
"Gund Baby Magical Wand Sound Toy, Pink, 9&quot;","So far, my 1 year old daughter likes this wand...but it's driving me up the wall! It only has one 'magical sound' that plays over and over, and it plays every time you pick it up, shake it, step on it, etc. Needless to say, hearing the same little sound over and over can grate even on the most patient of mothers' nerves. I'm giving it three stars because my baby girl likes it, and it is super cute, but mom and dad need ear plugs!",3
"Skip Hop Moby Bath Kneeler, Blue",cute and feels good on knees you do not notice how good this feels on your knees till after you use it.  Didn't notice that kneeling but the tube was hurtning my knees but you notice the difference after using this,5
"Leachco Wrap Strap Anywhere Safety Strap, Red","Love this! it works wonderfully on shopping carts, keeps my son from sliding all over the place. I love that it is wider than traditional cart seat belts.",5
"Decowall Dw-1205, 27 Transport Wall Stickers/wall Decals/wall Transfers/wall Tattoos/wall Sticker","We put these up on our toddler's walls recently and they're fantastic! The colors are very bright, they come off the backing without tearing, stick to the wall easily and are very easy to re-position. They're a good size too, so you don't need that many - unless you're like us and want to create a huge traffic jam around your child's bedroom!",5
Kid's Healthy Eating Cow Sippy Cup - With Dual Spill Proof or Freeflow Mode - Over 25 Million Sold,"I like the way it looks so much, i didn't care that it's only 99% leak proof.  I live in Wisconsin and we're cheese heads, so the cup is just the perfect print.  :)",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"We got this as a baby shower gift and just love it. We put my son in this since birth and he was always interested in it. He is now 2 1/2 months and still just loves this toy. The only problem was that after 1 month the vibrator part just got sooooo loud. Since we got it as a gift we did not have a receipt but Babies """"R"""" Us still exchanged it for a new one. We are still very happy with this product.",4
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Simple, soft, and washes well, we have a few of these, they are very soft, wash well and seem to wear well.",5
"Lamaze High-Contrast Little Knotties Baby Toy, Skunk",Love the contrast of the item and the rattle/crinkle features. Only reason the product didn't get 5 stars is the lack of a hook for hanging and the loop on top is pretty small (ok if you have small hooks/links).,4
"Cosco Funsport Playard, Into the Woods","Need an explanation as to how the Dream on Me 3"" mattress fits the Cosco Funsport Playard. Dimensions for Playard are 27.5 x 43.25 and the mattress dimensions are 25.5 x 37.5 which means 2 inches of space in width and 6 inches difference in length. I really love the playard and want to order but after reading the reviewer who stated that there was so much slack room between mattress, I am hesitant. Shouldn't the mattress be snug so the baby can't get trapped between?http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JU0H7I/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&smid;=ATVPDKIKX0DER and I had to go to an outside source to get the dimensions for both.",2
"Munchkin 4 Pack Re-Usable Twist Tight Spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",Beware.  These cups do leak from the spout.  Easy to wash and store.  Would not buy again as every time my son throws it the milk spills out.,1
Baby Luv Nightlight and Music Turtle and Animals (Black and White),"Sound is very loud! Stars are great. Baby loves all the colors. Songs are good, but far too loud, scares baby.",3

"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","These are the best nursing pads I have found so far. They do not show under clothes, and do not leak as long as you are not a heavy leaker. All other reusable nursing pads have leaked and been visible through my clothes. These are also incredibly soft and comfortable. I wish I had purchased them sooner!",5
"Brown Monkey Baby Bottle Holder for Hands Free Bottle Feeding by Bebe Bottle Sling, LLC",Must have baby item.Only down side it if the baby is not actively drinking from the bottle the bottle may leak onto the baby so make sure your baby is wearing a bib.,5
Ginsey Sesame Street Soft Potty Seat with Removable Soft Splash Guard,I have been struggling getting my son to even just sit on the potty. Adding this seat after a suggestion from a friend was the ticket. While he still is not ready to potty train the toilet doesnt seem as scary with this seat. It is comfy and has seasame street people on it. I actually got him to sit on the potty with this seat. I highly recommend this over a potty chair. You wont have to dump a bowl of pee or poo if you train them this way!,5
green sprouts Natural Bowl,"Received a couple of these bowls and initially loved them....I would hand wash and dry them and the kids would eat out of them....then about a week or two later, i suppose i didnt dry them good enough and took them out for the kids and there was mold all over them. we had to throw them out...waste of money.",1
"Evenflo Jump &amp; Go Baby Exerciser, Red Racer","i bought this for my nephew and although he did take a while to start jumping, he loves it. i recommend it for 5 month olds up.",5
Evenflo Titan Elite DLX Convertible Car Seat - Montgomery,"This child seat is a great buy - have had it for about 4 months now and am really impressed with it. My 16 month-old loves his comfortable seat, especially since he has started facing forward. The build quality is good, and the accessories are great - especially the ability to fit both the cup-holder and the little snack box on either side of this seat.The only issue I have with this seat is that it does not come with a neck-rest attachment. That would be a great addition to this seat, however I got myself one from the store real cheap...Overall, a great buy for the price...",4
"Philips AVENT 8 Ounce Natural Glass Bottles, 2-Pack",The glass bottles are nice but the whole bottle is useless all thanks to the new nipples. Our baby had a very tough time maintaining a good seal around the nipple and as a result milk would spill all around his neck. We initially thought it was the flow rate on the nipple but after trying different Avent nipples (that have slower flow rates) and getting the same messy results we decided to return the entire bottle set and get the Dr. Brown's glass bottle set instead.,1
"Pickles 30X40&quot; Journey Fleece Baby Blanket, Tiger","I love this blanket. I ordered it for my son who isn't here yet but will be arriving on the 9th. It is sooo soft and cozy, I'm really picky about fabrics but this blanket was well worth the price. cant wait to use it for my baby boy. good quality",5
"Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer 3-in-1 Potty Seat withPotty Wipes, 72-Count","The potty comes conveniently already set up and the first thing  I noticed when we opened it was the smell. Not a nasty smell, but a very nice smell that smells almost like something I can eat. It turned out to be the Arm & Hammer Deodorizing disc with odor eliminating baking soda which is used for odor control. I don't think I'll need an air freshener with that around. I love the fact that it can be used as a step stool and when my daughter stepped on it there was no fear of it tipping over. I must say that it is indeed sturdily made.Once it's opened it comes with this handy convenient toddler flushable wipes. Yay for your bathroom toilet because we all know you're not supposed to flush baby wipes down there. The great thing about these is that these comes as refills which can be purchased separately but it does come with 2 and each contains 36 wipes.The deodorizer was a very simple install. Just click and its in. Right above the potty seat.  The only problem I really had, and it was a very small problem was getting the flushable wipes in the side where it belongs. I love where it is located. My toddler can grab it easily and when she finally understand how to properly wipe she can do this for herself.The white removable trainer seat can be used on the toilet when she's big enough to use the adult toilet like a big kid. The green bowl is where everything is collected and is very easy to clean. It is relatively small compared to some we've seen but not too small to be considered unusable.We love that it is a complete potty training system. Now you longer have to buy a potty training seat for the toilet. You also don't have to buy a step stool either. The deodorizer is a very nice added touch. No one really needs to leave the bathroom smelling stinky. This will clearly clear up all that stinky smell. You will surely be saving money in the long run by buying this and to be honest you really don't need to buy the flushable wipes refill, they're really just recommended.So yes we love our new potty and we recommend it! It gets my toddlers Two Tiny Thumbs Up!  You can find a full review with photos on our blog GrowingUpMadison.com",5
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,"I bought these because my son loves to push his bowl, plate, cup, etc all over his highchair tray and then pick them up and dump them (usually on his head).  I thought the suction base on these would alleviate this, I was wrong and other reviewers were correct.  The suction does not work.  I tried the water trick and put all my force into sticking the bowl to his tray and within minutes he had it loose and had dumped his dinner on his head.It is nice that they come in bright and fun colors with secure lids though, makes it easy to store in the fridge or take snacks along on outings.",3
Cloth Diaper Doublers,"These are atually better then the ""liners"" of the same brand. They're cheap, and abosorb quite a bit, they're just small, I have to pair them with something else, and my 1 year old is not a heavy wetter. I can make better ones myself.",3
ECO CUP &amp; I Am Not a Paper Cup Replacement Coffee Cup Lid Blue Silicone,Great replacement lid.  My original lid developed a tear along the drinking area- not sure how.  I hope this replacement will last longer.,5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Love this stroller so far! It's perfect for my 10 month old son & I'm sure will be with us for a while to come. It folds up compact & fits nicely in the rear of our car. I love the pouch that fits over the handles. It can contain a lot of stuff. The stroller handles well. The only downside is the basket underneath is small, which I knew by reading other reviews. I can hang the diaper bag on the back & haven't had any worries of the stroller tipping over.",4
Triple 8 FLO Diaper Sprayer,Even on our low pressure well water this diaper sprayer worked really well. I love the ability to easily turn the water pressure up and down when you need to. Best diaper sprayer that we tried!,5
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I have tried pretty much everything on the market and these come closer to not leaking than any other I've tried.  I highly recommend them.,5
"Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock, 2 Count",Best idea EVER!!!,5
"C.R. Gibson Stepping Stones Baby Photo Album, Jungle Friends","It was very cute. I was looking for some thing for my oldest son's hand and foot prints seeing as his father never let me frame them and this matched his crib set he had 17 years ago! I was a bit disappointed with the construction of the frame it's just pressed paper, the ones I have for his younger siblings are ceramic. But I was just more happy with the fact that I had found his crib design after all these years. It does look great on the wall.",3
Nasal Aspirator in Sage,"The only nasal aspirator that works well is the one that comes home with the baby from the hospital. I have no idea where you can buy those, but they are most effective.",2
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I wish I had bought this years ago! It is spanned across our open concept home to keep my kids out of the kitchen/dining area. It is not wobbling like I thought it might, very sturdy and is working PERFECTLY! I now have a little bit of sanity back and am able to keep my home a lot safer for my young kids. I have also used it to hold my German Shorthair Pointer puppies. Love that the kids and dogs can't climb over it (so far!).",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We had two babies 17 months apart. They are 5 and 6 now and they still flop jump in there, especially my 5 year old son (his fort). We now have a 9 month old and I researched a lot of other 'play areas' etc but I'm going to end up buying the same thing. Safe, fun, will not collapse and fall down, etc. And&#8230;no little guy (9-14 months is hurling themselves out of this thing) From what I understand a lot of kids climb out of others that are shorter.Believe me, I'm done looking at this eye sore, but can say from experience that it will keep your little lady/guy safe and occupied and will stay with them a little while longer. **you do have to buy some cute secure hanging light up fun things when they are little for the sides. Besides that, I can't actually believe I'm buying the same thing 6 years later.  Worth it. My first Amazon review, btw.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"It works exactly the way it says it will.4 stars because of three small problems:1 - hinge should be slightly small, so that it doesn't scratch the door2 - it required little practice to lift it and tilt it to open3 - quality of screws supplied with it",4
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White",Perfect fit for the Davinci mini cribs.,5

"Zebra Baby Blanket in Faux Fur with Black Satin Ruffle and Ultra Lux Plush White Swirl on Back, An Alexander Timothy Designer Baby Throw","These are the softest baby blankets I have ever felt! My little boys loved them, even my baby who is hard to get to smile was grinning while holding it. Beautiful fabrics and perfect for snuggling little ones.",5
Edushape Small Sensory Balls,"My 1yr old loves them, they are easy to handle and fun to bounce!I recommend this product for babies and toddlers",5
Infantino Cozy Rider,My baby weighs 12 pounds and I found it very difficult to put him in and take him out of this carrier. His legs wanted to slide in the arm holes and his head was slouched too far down. I actually had to lay down on the bed to take him out of it. Bottom line--carrier is too hard to place baby in!! I ended up returning!!,1
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","easy to install, comfortable for my daughter, and comes with the safety of britax.  we were planning on getting a 3-in-1 but a friend told us that this is better for a 2-year old since the straps are lower and the seat is more padded.  we are happy we went with his recommendation.",5
"Sumersault 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Show Doggies",I love this collection. It is well made and the &#34;hand stitched&#34; look is adorable. I bought this for my son but I could see this in a girls room too. Who doesn't like puppies? I would suggest checking out ebay as there is an artist that does prints to match this collection. It adds the perfect finishing touch.,5
Funky Zebra Fitted Crib Sheet for Baby and Toddler Bedding Sets by Sweet Jojo Designs - Zebra Print Microsuede,Had this item within like 3 days of ordering it.. I love the zebra sheet it looks great in my little girls room.,5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Blue and White (Previous Model)","These wraps are huge. They make great swaddling blankets. I highly recommend them! They feel soft too, and they get softer with every wash. We use these to wrap our baby in after he wakes up from his naps; it keeps him warm but not too warm like a fleece blanket would. I also have been using them while nursing.",5
"Obersee Kid's All-in-One Pre-School Backpacks with Integrated Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings",Christmas present for grandson - he loves it and we will probably have to get him another one - I'm sure he'll wear it out one of these days!,5
"American Baby Company Full Size  30&quot; X  40&quot; - 100% Cotton Thermal Blanket, Blue",This is pretty much an average thermal weave baby-sized blanket. The color (green) is a bit different from the picture in the listing. Would probably be better off shopping locally at Target or WalMart for something like this.,2
Walker With Toy Bar,"I chose this walker because it's tray was free of clutter and easy to clean. The toy bear bar is easy to remove and reattach.  The wheels roll easily on hard wood floors without leaving marks, and is easy for baby to manuver.  It's seat has adjustable heights to accomodate the growing baby.  It is also balanced well so that baby can not tip it over.  We tend our grandson frequently and appreciate the freedom this gives each of us.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I really like our new Joovy Caboose stroller.  It was very easy to put together.  It fits in the trunk of my '04 Honda Accord.  My 3 year old toddler loves it because she has an option to sit or stand.My issues with this stroller:It is a little heavy but not too bad.  While sitting, my toddler will drag her feet or mess with the brakes, but that's not the strollers fault.  I also have no place to put my diaper bag if my 3 year old is riding.I'm glad I purchased this stroller even though it has a few issues.  It has allowed me to take my daughters to the zoo and do some shopping that I couldn't do without it.",4
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Love this pillow!!! I had been having a hard time sleeping especially on my left side, until I got this pillow. It worked immediately, I was able to take an uniterrupted 3 hour nap using this pillow about 30 min. after I opened it and read the directions/ looked at the demonstration pictures. I also used this pillow to support me as I sit up in bed (reading, eating, watching t.v.) and for extra support while sitting on the sofa. I've even caught my husband using it while sitting up in bed!! The size and shape may seem intimidating at first glance, but it's very easy to use.  The biggest drawback has been that it doesn't stay in it's pillowcases very well and finding a use for now that I am no longer pregnant.  I tried using it for nursing as its manual suggested, but found it too cumbersome.  I got a lot of use of it while I was pregnant though, and would buy it again.",4
Mac &amp; Cool Quick Cooling Dish,"Given the price of this item, most parents of toddlers should have one of these.  It's just flat out so useful to not have to stick plates of hot food in the freezer for a few minutes, or to deal with trying to spread out hot food on plates and blow on all of it.- really works for any hot food.  Any microwave food, etc- Cleans well- easy- Pop it right back in the freezerIt's just one of those no-brainer products.  It might seem gimmicky, but it's not really.  It's a basic thing that you will reach for every time you have something steaming hot and a hungry 2 year old.My daughter is just shy of 2, and I probably use this dish every other day.",5
"Graco Quilted Pack 'n Play Sheet, Light Blue",Fits great and offers decent padding for baby. Doesn't bunch up in the middle like some do. Love the baby blue color.,5
Medela Harmony to Symphony Conversion Kit,I bought this conversion kit for a pump that we are provided at work.  It is perfect and works great.  My only complaint is that there was only one in stock and I needed two.  I use this everyday and works like a champ!,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Cradle 'n Swing, Rainforest Friends",I was looking for a swing for my baby. And i found it here at amazon .And i really love it for the price.Its a good item.I recived in two days free shiping.I dont use the battery . Only the AC.This is my opinnion about the item.,5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",This is perfect for a new baby.  It's soft and warm and you completely zip off the top if it's too warm outside for it.  I love the graphite color - -we weren't sure if we were having a boy or girl so it would work well for either.  I haven't washed it yet but it appears it would clean up nice as well.,5
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"The thermometer works fine, unfortunately you will not find replacement covers ANYWHERE! and the thermometer will not function without a cover. I purchased my thermometer from ToysRUs and they don't even carry the covers. I'd recommend buying another brand, for example I've seen the Thermoscan covers almost everywhere I've looked.",1
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Lavender Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,I really like this purchase. The butterfly theme is great and the purple goes great with gray!!! Can't wait for my baby to enjoy the room as much as me.,5
"First Essential Silicone Bottle, 9 Ounce, Pack of 3, Blue/Green, 9-Count","Being a first time mom I spent months before my LO was born trying to decide what bottles to buy just in case breast feeding didn't go as I had planned. I bout several different &#34;special, no air, no bubbles, etc&#34; bottles that cost a lot more than these. After maybe 2 weeks of breast feeding I ran out of milk, those special bottles I wasted time and money on all looked like they could keep air out but ended up having him taking more air in because their thought of making the bottles more realistic to act as a breast or be formed like one is not a good idea at all. There will never be a bottle that can replace your breast, I see that now. I have bought the most expensive and least expensive, the closer it gets to seeming perfect it ended up being worst. These bottles worked the best, believe it or not out of all the bottles he gets little to no air with this one only!! His lips can go completely around the top and the suction power he can get by latching on to the small nipples allows him to avoid any gaps that cause him to suck in air like the bigger more complicated nipples to mimic real breastfeeding. Love it & at 8 months he is still using them, moving on to sippy cups now.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Received three extension pieces with this set.  It works, can't find much to complain about.  If you have a big dog, or a big baby who may have the strength, they can probably damage the spindles or move the gate if they place a lot of pressure on it.",4
The First Years Babypro Sterilizer,Its a great idea but needs improvement.Dont use this to clean breast flow bottle nipples...they will start to melt.Hard to clean but fits many many things to clean.,3
Playtex Diaper Genie On The Go Dispenser Refills,We love this. It's so small and easy to clean up on the go with this little gem. So much easier than packing around random plastic bags. So many places won't let you throw away diapers and it makes it easy to take dirty diapers with us. Bags have a gentle scent as well.,5
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","Definitely, the only diaper sacks I use now.  They are roomy, strong, and you get a ton in the box.  They fit easily in your purse or diaper bag.I tried another brand I bought at Target.  They fell apart in a heartbeat and I was back to the Sassy Baby ones!",5
Saddle Style Soaker Mattress Pad - Will Absorb 6 Cups of Liquid - Made in America (34&quot; X 36&quot;),"I was happy with the quality just disappointed that the pee pad does not cover a normal size twin mattress and the siding starts before the sides of the twin bed begins. So, I hope my son is never laying near the sides of the bed and has an accident or it will leak through!",4
Bright Starts 2-in-1 Convert Me Activity Table and Gym,"Fabulous gift for a very young baby. And, it converts later to a table baby can use as he grows.",5
"BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon, Turquoise/Orange, 2-Count",Clings to high-chair table-top and is very hard to tip over by baby as she feeds herself and not too deep.,5
"Badger Basket Two Bin Storage Cubby, Red",I have had these cubbies for about 1.5 years. Structurally they have held together very well.  These are extremely handy for storage. The cubbies were easy to assemble. They stack together perfectly and do not slide around. The finish has  worn more than I think it should have. They came with cheesy brown stickers to cover the screws. The stickers will have to be replaced over time. This purchase was a good value for the cost.,5
"Gunamuna Gunapod Wearable Baby Sleepsack, Chocolate, Medium","This is a comfy, unique, zippers everywhere dream sack! What I love most is that you can unzip the bottom to change diapers in the middle of the night w/o baby getting cold! And it washes so well.",4
"Kids Line Jungle 123 Hamper, Brown",This hamper looks just like the picture.  It is a useful size.  It has a mesh liner which makes removing the dirty clothes very easy. You can through the liner in the wash too.  It also means you don't have to wash the actual hamper (which probably wouldn't work too well).,5
"Infantino Breathe Vented Carrier, Grey","We registered for this carrier before my son was born.  To its credit, it does feel fairly secure; he seems comfortable and it carries him snugly against me.  Two major problems.1.  Without a waist strap, it is very hard to get the baby out of the carrier without help.  When you try to lift him out, the entire carrier rises up instead of the baby sliding out.  We bought an Evenflo carrier at Walmart for $30 for my husband to use (so we wouldn't have to adjust the straps every time we switched who carries him).  That one has a side opening, which makes it easier to get the baby out.  Also, it has a waist strap so the entire carrier doesn't rise up when you lift the baby out.2.  Larger concern.  Almost every time I take my son out of this, I scratch his chubby little thighs.  There is a stiff place in the carrier that rubs against the baby's legs when you pull him out.  It's not bad - hasn't drawn blood or anything and he's never fussed about it.  But it leaves a little pink mark on the outside of his thighs.I think we're going to give up on this carrier and buy another one with a waist strap for me to use so I can get him in and out without help and without scratching his legs.  The Infanito is a decent product for the low cost (especially compared with some that are over $100) but there are better options out there without paying too much more.",2
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"My husband and I debated about whether a bottle warmer was even necessary, but in the end - I won, and this is the one I chose!  This little unit is extremely handy for middle of the night feedings.  I had the timing down so that the bottle would finish warming almost exactly when I would be done changing my daughter's diaper.  Any amount of time that you can save in the middle of the night is worth it in my opinion.  However, I also found that you have to pay attention to what kind of bottle you're trying to heat and make sure you measure the right amount of water to put in the unit, so that the bottle gets heated enough.  If you set yourself up before you go to bed and fill the included water vials which attach neatly to the side, you won't have to be figuring these things out at 3 am!Overall, we've been very happy with this unit - especially the cooler section in the back!  That's another great feature that allows you to not have to make a trip to the fridge in the middle of the night!!",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I wish I had read the detailed reviews before purchase - I bought this as a travel bed for my nearly-18-month daughter. She adored it as a place to sit, but lying down on it was impossible because the strap that runs through the middle doesn't yield at all (leaving her with something digging into and raising her middle). We tried to open it out as much as possible, thinking extra tension on the rest of the cot would help, but it didn't. It would definitely require something like two pillows or a thick pad of some kind, which renders it useless to me because I would primarily be using it for the times when I travel alone with her and need to pack as lightly as I can manage. I am in the process of returning this.",1
Prorap Classic Diaper Covers - White - Large,"I bought three of these nine months ago for our little guy; he was a year old then (is now 20 months old) and these wraps have been great.  I have tried to refrain from putting them in the dryer, but we have forgotten more than a few times and they still work great.  The wraps we had before (a different brand) lost their waterproof quality after being washed and dried in the dryer a few times.  The only problem, which is easily fixed, is if you don't line up the velcro, the edges curl slightly and can irritate baby's skin about where a diaper pin would be.  No problem if you just stick your hand inside between the velcroed part and baby to make sure you don't feel anything rough and if you do, adjust it a little.",5
"36 Baby Spoon Souvenir Spoon Display Case Rack Cabinet, REAL Glass Door, (SP01-WA)","This is the second cabinet I have ordered from this company and as advertised, its just what I had hoped for. They hold all of my wife's spoons from our travels in one place, (Thank God!) as her collection has continued to grow.The quality of this item is high end, all wood components and includes hanging brackets for wall mount.Look no further, this is the real deal.",5
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-Luxe Stroller, Sebby Teal","Excellent lightweight stroller overall. I only wish It was a little bit easier to fold with one hand, when carrying the baby.",4
BUMKINS BPA FREE Super Bib 3 pack Dr. Seuss design,"BEST BIB EVER!  Seriously!  You will NEVER need another one.  WAterproof, but not hard, inflexible, or uncomfortable.  You will be absolutely AMAZED at the amount of money you'll save from not having to buy so much stain remover.  I used to go through about 2-3 bottles of stain remover a month, now it's 1/2 to 1!  Machine-washable, too!",5
Stephan Baby Silver Plated 4&quot; Keepsake Rattle,"My 8 month granddaughter started playing this rattle as soon as I put it in her hand!  Purchased this rattle to help her sore gums.  Also to replace the silver heart bracelet I wear that she loves to chew.  The rattle is much better, she loves it.",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,Absolutely great cup; easy  to use and doesn't spill but I am uncomfortable putting milk on it since the straw is so difficult to clean but I don't regret the purchase. My son loves it.,4
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","Our grandson notices the movement and music, but the stuffed animals seem like blobs to adults. Maybe they look better to babies, but they aren't very well defined. I do like the fact that it can be moved from crib to play yard",3
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,"This pump was recommended by one of the nurses from my breastfeeding class.  I'm glad she recommended it because it works great and was less expensive than Medela's pumps.  It doesn't come with a bag, but I just use an extra diaper bag to carry the pump in to and from work.  I highly recommend!!  Part can be bought at Babies R Us too.",5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,Really colorful and carches my grandson's attention. He plays with it and finds new parts to it each time a new discovery,5
Diaper Dude Chicago Cubs Diaper Bag,"A diaper bag that a man will carry, YEAH!!!!!  Sometimes I use if we are carrying alot.  The messager bag style allows for comfort and keeps the bag out of your way.  Worth the money.",5
"ERGObaby Front Pouch, Camel","I've been using this as a purse since I got it two days ago.  The strap is a perfect length for a crossbody carry and it's so tiny I don't even have to take it off when I get in the car.  It also velcros around the strap of my Beco Gemini, on a side or back of the waist strap (beco doesn't make a comparable product).  I will mostly use it on the carrier when we travel on airlines, and it will work fine for that, boarding passes will fit in folded in half.  For reference, my cell phone is the size of an Iphone, and it fits comfortably and completely in the open pocket, but a larger tablet crossbreed like a Galaxy OneNote would probably only fit inside the big compartment.  The big compartment is only wide enough to hold a pair of sunglasses or something similar.  A newborn or maybe a size one diaper might fit, but you would have to really smoosh it in, but I didn't buy it for a diaper bag replacement, so I don't care about that personally.",5
Blankets and Beyond Rosette Baby Blanket with Toy Rattle Blue,I bought this for a friends baby shower. She loved it. Its so soft inside and out and comes with a cute bunny rattle for a very good price. I wish I had one when my son was that little,5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,After searching for burp cloths my girlfriend recommended using these.  Let me tell you...it was the best purchase I made.  They are the perfect size and are very absorbant.  I have yet to be surprised with what these diapers can't do!,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,Great stroller and the price is awesome for an item of this quality.,5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator - Choose from Blue or Magenta Colors (Blue),"First off I want to start by saying this item works. Now that that's said, you are Basicly sucking snot from your kids nose. The only thing between you and snot is a piece of tissue. Very simple to use and effective. Your just sucking snot. If you can get over this, your home free.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This is definitely one of the better options for a double-sided bed rail. However, the installation instructions were a bit odd and it took a while to get it secure enough that I felt safe with my toddler in it. So far it's done the job perfectly!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It is a bit pricey, but our son loves his Sophie the Giraffe!  Even though he doesn't really hold onto things yet he likes to put her feet in his mouth and watch me move her in front of him.  Can't wait until he starts to play on his own with her, it is nice to know she's safe to chew on!",5
"Jeep Back Seat Baby View Mirror, Black","Like that there are vertical and horizontal straps, HOWEVER, the horizontal straps weren't long enough to wrap all the way around my car's headrest (Acura MDX).  I love that the mirror telescopes and is a nice neutral black.  The cushion is a nice touch too, to not gouge your headrest... but since the straps didn't fit, I couldn't use it.  Am using the Britax one instead.",2
"6-Pack BPA Free Waisted Baby Bottles, 6 oz., Girl Colors","The baby bottles are great, but the only issue i have is that the nippples are too small for the rings, therefore it leeks.",3
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"I did  some research and read numerous favorable  reviews for this high  chair.  It easy to assemble, just the right size, and adjustable.  The product description is true to it's word that is easy to clean, including  the safety straps.  Also love that I can attach and release the tray with one hand. Baby is currently 6 months old and weighs 16.5  lbs. There is lots of room for him when he gets bigger.  As an added bonus, the price is also the most economical for all the  features it has.  For anyone buying baby products, I would recommend reading different web site reviews, which are free to view.  Also,  there are Consumers Reports articles and ratings (there is an annual subscription cost to see on line CR ratings)",5
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","My daughter loves her Philips Avent BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup.  Instead of transitioning to a sippy cup, we opted to go straight to a 'normal' cup rim.  We had to guide her at first, but she quickly learned to grab the handles and drink for herself.  She is now 1 year old and independently drinking from this cup.  It is leak proof, as long as baby isn't pressing down on the pressure plate and holding it at an angle!  Comes apart quickly and cleans easily, but we only use this for water anyway.",4
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red",I love the idea of this and the quality is good but we hardly use it because it doesn't fit on a lot of tables due to their thickness.The image shows a table about 1.5 inches thick. The granite bar in the kitchen was too thick and the patio table was too thin so I had to add a piece of plywood.,3
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"This gate only looks nice on one side. From the other side, you can see why the gate is so flimsy. It is very poorly designed. Also, to adjust this gate for a different location in your house, you have to loosen and then tighten 4 screws.I recommend model 41823 instead. It looks better, feels sturdier, and is easier to adjust. It is also harder for a toddler to climb.",1
GIRAFFE CoziCover (for SoftSpot by Wozzy Play Mat),This cover is very soft and fits the mat well. It's also made in a way that spit up is easily wiped up and doesn't soak in or stain.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru","I ordered this gate to put at the top on stairs outside because it matched the color. It came with one of the spindles already broken on the bottom, but decided to keep it anyway. I tried to use the pressure method to secure it to the side rails but it would come off every time it was opened and the pressure was released. I did not want to drill holes because then I would have a rust issue with the wrought iron. So I used heavy duty zip ties to hold it in place. It is a temporary solution until I replace the gate with a wrought iron gate.",3
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,I love this item -  it's so cute and well made.  Perfect for our woodland themed nursery.  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!,5
"BFlowerYan Door Stop Finger Pinch Guard , Mixed Color [4pc-pack] (4xanimal)","Wow, I was really impressed that these cute foam animals work! Even when my husband slams the door they do the job.",5
"Summer Infant Fox &amp; Friends Sweet Comfort Musical Bouncer, Espresso",I preordered this item and when it finally came in stock I received it faster then expected! Great bouncer for the price. Easy to put together. Can't wait to have our soon to be here baby test it out,5
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","We got this product as a gift and did not realize at the time how necessary it is!  In a new parents' tired confused stupor waking every hour to 2 hours for weeks at a time, it is hard to remember what happened over the course of a blurry sleepless night.  This was mostly useful at night.  My husband was very helpful taking turns getting up in the middle of the night but without referring to the itzbeen, I would have to wake him back up to find out whether he fed her, changed her diaper, when he got up last, etc.The only downside is that the timers have been resetting themselves lately.  Maybe the batteries are dying...We're definitely going to buy the Itzbeen as gifts for expecting friends / family!",4
Slip-X Solutions Tub Tattoos: Clownfish,"They sold it, I bought it. I see they didn't review my purchase, but I'm being asked to review their sale.  I bought it, they sold it.",5
"Perfect Bum Fashion Basic Print Kit, Floral Tile, Small","I am loving this product!  The inserts need a little spot remover before being washed after a messy diaper, but otherwise it works great!",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","This blanket is nice because it is a little more flexible to the size of your baby, but does not cause baby to stop fidgeting or sleep through the night as suggested... but maybe this is just my baby.",3
BEABA Babycook PRO - Sorbet,"We bought this for our daughter who has twins. She says it is very easy to use and it does a great job of preparing meals for her kids. Twins are a hand full and time is very valuable, so meets all of her expectations.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink","This kick and play occupies my daughter for hours daily. She started using it around a month a half. Every month (4 months now) she loves it more and more. She spends hours laughing at herself in the mirror and kicking on the piano. It's a very versatile product that can be used for a long time because it has so many convertible options, also. This is a must-have for every parent.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I bought this carseat a couple of months ago and it does its job :)  I have an Eddie Bauer one as well, so I have to say compared to that one it's bulkier/material's not as soft/straps and the buckle aren't as ""comfortable"" as the Eddie Bauer one, but it works great!  My son looks happy and comfortable in it, kids aren't usually as picky as we adults are about those kinds of things LOL I'm glad I bought it, great size, great price, love the cup holder!",4
"timi &amp; leslie Tag - a - Long Diaper Bag, Sahara Brown",Love the pockets inside and out. Perfect to sort and store multiple things especially if you want to put in something ina hurry,4
"The Shower Hug for Pregnant and Nursing Moms., X/S, White with Petal Pink Trim","I didnt' have this product when i had my first baby, and i remember having VERY sensitive nipples pre birth and post birth (especially with early breastfeeding). The shower stung as it hit my nipples and even the mildest soaps & shampoos burned!! So I got this to use for my 2nd pregnancy/post birth and i LOVED it.  it shielded my nipples from stinging shower spray and soaps/shampoos, while also holding the warmth of the water on my boobs. I loved it so much I've gifted this to two mamas-to-be!",5
Infantino Wonder Whale Kicks and Giggles Gym,This is a great toy that encouranges interest and strengthens kicking with good visual motor skills coordination.  Babies love this and it keeps them content.,5
"C.R. Gibson Slim Bound Journal Album for Photos, Happi Baby Girl",This photo album is cute and so far has held up very well. There is space to write next to each picture and the design is one of the cutest I've seen for boy photo albums.,5
"Carters Super Soft Bumper, Pink","My wife thought about making bumpers, but for the time and cost of materials it was better to just buy these. They are soft and work great, especially when your baby starts to crawl around. No more waking up to crying with her head mashed against the crib sides.",5
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"I bought this product specifically to put in the back window of my Camry, since it showed pictures of being used in the back window. Well, it certainly stopped the sun from getting in my baby's eyes. Unfortunately, it also stopped me from being able to see out my back window. It was also not that easy to install. If you're looking for something for a window you need to see out of, this is not it. (If you find something that actually works for that purpose, please let me know!)",2
Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set,This sheet set is great! After reading some of the reviews I decided to try anyway since the price was good. I was pleasanly surprised! The entire set was actually super soft and not stiff at all! Right out of the package! I love it! The colors are vibrant and no wrinkles after wash and dry! I LOVE IT! and so does my 2 1/2 year old!,5
"Baby Aspen Farm Fannies Diaper Cover, Cow","Wish that Baby Aspen made Farm Fannies in more than just this one version! I'd buy the whole darn farm if it was available. These are stinkin' cute, well made, & adorable fabric. Would totally recommend. My babies butt is the cutest.",5
"phil&amp;teds Traveller Crib, Black","Phil and Teds is a marketing company. They purchased the company from a father and son (Phil and Ted) and have lost all sense of quality. This crib, is lite and looks good but that is where it stops. The inflatable mattress does not provide enough padding, the materials leak color and the frame is weak. We (and my brother) have retuned ours.",1
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"Purchased this for my baby at 6 months. Baby loved touching the different textures, spinning it, listening to the rattling sounds when it spins, looking at the colors. At 7.5, it is still one of her favorites. She still love doing all the stuff previously mentioned, but now she is strong enough to pluck the wonder wheel off a table and disengage the suction cup holding it down. She likes to flip it upside down and chew on the rubbery suction cup. She likes banging it around and then flinging it on the floor and watch me pick it up for her. This little thing provides baby with lots of entertainment value. Would recommend.",5
"Stork Craft Aspen Combo Dresser Chest, Natural","First off, I did not get this item from Amazon, I got it from a big store for $100 dollars less. Also I chose this item because it was an appropriate height for me and my fiance, we are very tall!Whenever I get furniture that must be assembled, the first thing I do is organize the parts and take inventory.Let me repeat that: I TAKE INVENTORY.After organizing all of the little hardware pieces into ice cube trays I thought I was missing two parts, but upon calling storkcraft, A very nice man explained to me that part N just looks different than the illustration, and that parts O and P come screwed together, I wasn't missing any parts.Parts 1, 9, and 5 seem like they are not labeled, but they are...just in a more roundabout way. 1 and 5 have two stickers on them, 1 has 2 and 3 because parts 2 and 3 go in on those sides.Other items that weren't labeled were probably not labeled because their was only one of them and its obvious what it is, also the less stickers I have to remove the happier I am.Granted, I hate instructions without words. But I am an intelligent human being, and with some patience and planning my fiance and I put this together with relative ease in just about 2 hours. We only messed up once and it was an easy fix.Everything was packages nicely, the only dings came from us.WE PUT IT TOGETHER CORRECTLY AND IT IS EXTREMELY SOLID. The people that reviewed this item and said it was cheap, or unstable clearly did not put it together correctly or have the patience to attempt to understand the instructions.I mean, for the $250 I spent, I feel like we got a really good piece of furniture that will last many children. Also, you can't get solid wood furniture for under $700, it's impossibly. Yes the drawer bottoms are particle board, but it's a $300 dresser, what do you expect?UPDATE: two years later and it is still doing ok. The biggest ""fail"" is that the guide rails for the drawers shimmied loose, but we glued them back in. And the door squeaks. Also the knobs kind of suck, but again, we just glued them and they are fine. This is not an heirloom piece, but it works just fine.",4
"Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","I think there are better options out there, my son is 6 months and the car seat has always been very heavy and now the straps are too short. I recommend you look at other options, plus the fabric does makes my son sweat sometimes. If I were to buy a car seat for infants again I would not buy this one.",2
Hallmark 2011 - My 4th Fourth Christmas,This was just what we were looking for. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thank you once again Amazon *****,5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,Super convenient!,5
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,I bought this for a gift for my niece. It actually came with battery's that were dead of course. But once i installed a fresh set she totally loved it she is 8 years old.,5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,Bought this for my granddaugter when she was about 6 months old.  It's very colorful and easy to grab. She loves thespinning parts and the mirror.  Keeps her entertained.,4
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"We bought this for our four month old (he's almost five months) because we went back in for a missed vaccination and he took it like a champ..no tears! While looking around Walmart, we stumbled across this toy in the baby section. We showed it to him and he was instantly interested (he hasn't found many toys that he really seems to like). Since that day, he has  played with this toy every day. He chews on it, he bats at it, he watches mesmerized as I make the little button squeak (which of course is also a hit with the dogs....). This toy was also cheaper at Walmart. Under seven dollars! Worth every penny. Totally recommend! (and this is my second child, so I'm no stranger to the baby toy market!)",5
"Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Small 6-18 Lbs","The quality of this product is great: thin, super absorbent. I usually put one or two on top of a bumgenius microfiber insert in a Thirsties or Econobum cover. I love how soft and breathable the fabric is for my LO's diaper area. Since it is so absorbent, it takes twice as long as my other inserts to dry even tho it is much thinner than my other diapers or inserts. I would make sure you have lots of variety in your stash so you aren't just waiting around for the hemp products to dry but it really does make a great addition to any stash. Also, they stain super easy...I haven't tried to sun them out or anything (it doesn't bother us) but I thought I'd mention it.",4
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"It's sometimes tough to find a bottle a nursing baby will take, but I'm had success with both my kids using this bottle.  I like how it really vents the air, unlike cheap bottles that suck in on themselves as the kids is drinking them.  I also like how the bottom comes off for easy cleaning. You just have to be careful putting the little rubber thing back in the bottom.  If you don't get it just right, it leaks a bit.  This set is a great value and I love the variety of sizes and nipple flows it comes with.  BPA Free -- a definite must in my book.  These and Tommee Tipee's are my go-to bottles (but these come in first place)",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","i was a little confused at first on how to put them on, but got it all put together and looks really good.",4
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles",This seat came quickly and is easy to put together. My son loves it! Great price and I like how it makes into a booster seat.,5
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,"Good gate, easy to use and install. Just what I needed to keep my pooches contained on the deck. The shipment arrived in great time and shape. Very pleased.",4
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily","I ordered this for a trip I was taking with my 8 month old baby. He sleeps so well in his crib normally, the pack n play I have to take on trips for him to sleep in has a card board for a mattress. It's pathetic. Anyway, I brought this with me and was very pleased to see how thick and comfy it was. It didn't fit the pack n play perfectly, but I was able to stuff the 2in gap with soft blankets. I was worried he might roll in the crack in the middle of the night and it disturb is sleep, never woke up once!! I'd recommend this to anyone.",5
Sassy Water-Filled Teethers 2 Pack,I am all about cute thing affordable! My baby girl is now just starting to get her little teeth and these work great and for the price you can't go wrong![...],4
"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Rosin","After my daughter outgrowing her carrier carseat after a mere 6 months, we needed a carseat that was rear facing, but able to contain her ever-growing body.  However, we wanted one where it would be used far longer than 6 months.  Enter the Graco Smartseat.  It has the handy base of the Snugride, but it can be rear-facing, forward facing, and eventually becomes a child booster seat.  This thing is HUGE and heavy.  Sure, the base makes installation easy, but the seat is so heavy that you really don't want to move it back and forth between cars.  But you won't have a flip over on right hand turns because it snaps through the seat belt in addition to the LATCH systems, so you don't have to worry if it's JUST right.  This thing is so heavy that gravity holds it in place anyway.  However, I don't recommend this seat if you have a car smaller than a fullsize sedan.  It's a snug fit in our car, squeezing between our headrests in the front seat.  I recommend trying it out at Babies R Us First before buying to make sure it fits your car.Another bonus is that the adjustment strap that you pull.  Most seats you have to pull down to tighten, but that's almost impossible if the seat is rear-facing since the seats are pushed together.  Not so with this one - you can pull UP.  There is also no rethreading the straps as your child grows.  You extend the back of the seat while it's still in the car.  Sure, it's a pricey seat, but it's one that will last.  You really get $300 of seat.",4
Dapper Snapper Toddler Belt BLACK,"This is an essential piece in my son's wardrobe since so many of his pants do not fit him around his waist.  I've tried finding toddler belts but to no avail.  The dapper snapper stays snapped and because there are multiple grommets, I can adjust the size very easily.  I've had this for over a year from the time my son was 1-1/2 and he's still using it at 3.  What's great is that you do not have to unbuckle a belt in order to change his diaper which would be a problem at his day care.  I highly recommend it and in fact would recommend buying a couple.  You can easily lose one or forget it on a pair of pants that goes to the laundry.",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",My son loves his hands to be free so I wrap it under his arm pits. That also gives his legs more room to kick. When my hisband puts it on him he always gets out. I don't know what he does diffrently?? When I use it I never have that problem. I've have this brand and another brand. This one if my favorite. I wish I never bought the regular blankets like at the hospital. I rarely use them now.,5
Aden + Anais Issie Security Blanket Set Declan Elephants,"I bought these blankets because i realized my baby liked feeling cloth against her face before she fell asleep, so I bought these because the material is breathable.  I was afraid that she could choke herself if I got her other thicker blankets.  She loves them.  I bought 2 packets so she would have one in her crib, car seat and at day care.  At first I would let her fall asleep with it and then I would take it away, but now at 6 months, I let her sleep with them in her crib.  We have had no problems.",5
Summerside Activity Table with 2 Drawers - Oak,This train table is very heavy and made of solid wood. It is sure to be durable enough for even the most rambunctious toddlers. I like this table because it can be used as a coffee table as well as an activity table. I bought it when it was only $99 but I feel like it is worth much more than that. The only problem I had was putting together the 2 storage bins. It was short 1 of the allen head bolts. Also the bins don't seem quite as durable as the table itself but for the price the fact that bins were included is amazing! It's not perfect but it's a great choice if you want a versatile table that will last longer than a childs love for trains. My son is a huge train lover (at 3 years old) but I'm sure he will be into legos and other stuff in the near future. My son loved putting all of his trains in the bins so that also might help with learning to keep toys picked up. The price jumped to $199 since I bought it but I'm sure it will drop again soon. So for $99-$120 I would buy it again without question!!,4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,Love this product.  I have a 14 month old and 3 year old who love them.  I did buy a funnel but found a spoon worked best for me. I will probably buy another set so I can have more ready to go.  They wash nicely and are made well.,5
See Me Smile Infant Mirror Tan Bear,"This was the perfect solution for our problem -- not having a separate headrest.  Most other mirrors require a headrest for installation.  This can be attached to the LATCH tether at the top of the seat.  Also, with the beanbag stabilizer, it doesn't vibrate at all.  Another bonus is that it's incredibly easy and quick to install.  There are a couple of great YouTube videos made by the inventor of the mirror that show how easy it is to install.  If you're on the fence at all, go check those out... they have one video for installing on a head rest and one for cars without a head rest.  I watched both before buying and was pretty sure this would meet our needs, and I'm pleased that it has.  The mirror is big and very clear and easy to see from the front seat.  I would definitely recommend it to other parents who want to keep an eye on their little ones.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","I am in love with Aden + Anais products! These bamboo swaddling wraps are great! They are super soft, and a big enough for multiple use! Yes, they are great for swaddling...but also great for the stroller, tummy time etc. I highly recommend these!",5
"BRICA Day &amp; Night Light Musical Auto Mirror for in Car Safety, Grey","The mirror, if you can get it positioned where you need it, is great.  The light is never bright enough to see your child.  The music isn't so soothing for my baby either.  I had to get creative to get this in a position to see my baby.  The strap on the back is horrible. All you really need is the mirror.",2
"Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","Initially, I ordered two of these Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds from another website, liked them so much that I ordered two more from Amazon to have 4 total.  After the initial washing (never been used by the baby), I noticed the stitching was not right on one of them (Lot #4140 to be exact).  It appeared to be creating small holes in the cotton, like the stitching was tearing the cotton.  Coincidentally, but truthful, one of the original prefolds (from another website) had done the same thing, same Lot #4140!  I had already done the warranty information for that one, but ordered from Amazon because otherwise, I really liked this prefold (hence 3 stars).  Thirsties is taking care of the first warranty, I just finished contacting them about the second.The hoop design is nice for drying.  Also, line drying doesn't result in as much hard fabric as some of my other prefolds do, I still put in to tumble dry for a bit to soften all my cottons anyway.  If it weren't for the stitching problems (50% are problematic so far), I would've ranked it 5 stars.Maybe they'll figure out the problems, because I'd really love to promote this one!",3
Bearington Baby Pink Wiggles Snuggler,"I was disappointed that the bear was not able to open up flat. my grandchildren need to cover their faces in order to fall asleep, so it does not work.",3
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"These tiles look great, but the animals are peeling after only a few months of use. Lovely design, but functionally not good quality. Hopefully there is no toxicity in the paint. Replacing it just in case.",2
Medela Nipple Shield Regular 24mm,"These were a lifesaver for my child (who had a weak suck from birth).  We went 2 weeks without it but she was really struggling to latch & my ability to nurse was being compromised.  A lactation consultant told me that it's better to use one of these if absolutely necessary than to stop nursing from difficulties with latching.She saved us!!  My baby used this for the next 3 weeks or so & then I slowly weaned her off of it with the help of a lactation nurse & MOPS group.  We are still going strong & she's 5 months old.I definitely think people should try their VERY best to go au naturale when it comes to nursing but if you're doing everything you can & it still isn't working, this could be your answer.  Yes, carrying around a Nipple Shield is a pain but if you get help/advice from a nurse you can wean off of this in no time when your baby figures it out.Oh & some babies never develop a great latching ability.  My baby is still a pain & doesn't want to work for her meal....she's just come to realize that her mommy is MUCH more stubborn than her =)  Good luck!",5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Playgio Play Yard, Red","Couldn't be happier with my purchase. I was going to go with a more expensive one with the bassinet and toy bar but since my daughter is about 8 mos old, I decided on this. Couldn't be happier. You can't really see the pad on the bottom of the picture but it's completely black and seems like it would hold up for a good amount of time.  It's also way bigger than I expected it to be. Great color and very functional. Super easy to set up. I didn't even really need the directions. All in all a great playard.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents seem to do for some reason and we hated it!  The new design is jsut as poor as the original!  It's a total pain to empty and change the bags.  And the bag get a bit costly after a while!  And no matter how we spun the thinkg we still ended up with one big bag of nasty diapers...not ""sausage links"" for us!It was a total waste of money!  We returned ours after a couple of weeks and got the Diaper Champ.  We love that thing!  No bags to buy and no stupid spinning!  Save your time money, and sanity...go with a Diaper Champ!",1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Our daughter is breastfed, so we wanted bottles with softer nipples. A lot of other brands have nipples that feel very plastic. We have loved this bottles in that our daughter will drink from them--and we've tried about 4 or 5 other nipples--but we hate that they leak. It's like a constant slight drip onto our little girl while she's eating. Unfortunately, after experiencing this, my wife checked online to see if anyone else has had this issue and many other parents have. We can't get them to stop leaking, but we still use them because these are the only nipples our daughter will take.",3
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","There is nothing to keep the baby swaddled (like velcro on the SwaddleMe blankets). It was also huge for our newborn... I can't imagine swaddling a baby large enough to fit in this. And it was $30! It was a complete waste of money, and we have never used it. We ended up getting the SwaddleMe brand as hand-me-downs and LOVE those ones.",1
3ct Diamond Pacifier (278 Pave Set Diamonds),I am SO glad I had three kids! I had to sell my first born to provide this for my third. My second child went blind when the sun caught the diamond at a strange angle but we are Adjusting well. The baby never cries anymore! Sure his head is buried on his chest due to the weight if the object and when he falls asleep with it in his mouth (on his back-clearly!) it is so weighed down into his mouth it NEVER falls out! He can't even flip over in his sleep thanks to the paci! We have been using this since day one and tomorrow he turns five. Thankful we bought this!,4
"Clek Olli Booster Car Seat, Jet",Attached quickly and securely to the latch system in 2004 car. Matches interior well and my son says it is the most comfortable chair he owns.,5
"NUK Orthodontic Silicone BPA Free Nipple Bottle, 5 Ounce, Single Pack, Colors May Vary",Very good if you are  feeding both breastmilk and formula to a new born.  Also helped my son who has very bad colic.,4
"Kids Line Nightlight, Star Blue","I bought this as a gift for a cousin-- the price is cheaper than in Baby R Us, and it's a substantially sized nightlight that's well painted and looks good. I used it as the main gift in a baby basket full of stuff and it looked very good. I'm not sure I'd highly recommend on its own, as I don't think it would go very well with too much other than the entire Dena Happi Tree set, but that's what they are doing their babies nursery in so it was definitely a good buy. It seems kind of heavy, but also sturdy and well made. It was shipped well also-- no damages or problems.All in all, I would definitely recommend it, especially if it's on a gift recipient's registry as you're saving ~$5 and getting a good quality item.",4
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","Initially, I thought this item was kind of silly.  Cute, but impractical. After I got it home, I LOVE IT!  It takes up very little space, but can be packed with a ton of baby bottles, pacifiers, etc. I use the Dr. Brown's bottles and love it for drying all of the many parts and pieces. Very easy to clean. Excellent item!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"freddy is AWESOME. my son loves this little guy. one of his favorite toys to gnaw at. sometimes he just stares at the black and white patterns on the back of freddy's wings. nowadays he's into the red teething plastic. when we take freddy out, other little kids/babies come and try to snatch him away from our baby. freddy just attracts babies like crazy! luv luv luv this product",5
Koala Baby - Moonbeam 6 Piece Bedding Set,"Adorable!  The bedding is gorgeous and can be used for a boy or a girl. The bedding also has a lot of accessories for the nursery.  We have the lamp, wall hangings and pillow. The colors are great and the bedding is very soft.  I originally did not like the bedding when I viewed it online, but when I saw it in the store I knew that this was it!",5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red",this his perfect. My son is 9 months old but is as big as most 1 year olds. this play pen is the perfect size for him and his toys!!  He takes his naps in there and is very comfortable.  It collapses easy once you get the hang of it and is very portable from room to room.  Its kind of heavy so I dont think I'll be transporting it anywhere outside of my home but its great so far!,5
Z. Daisy Chandler Camo Binkie Bungee Pacifier Clip,Perfect! It's light weight and soft. So cute! The elastic has lasted longer than I expected. Still using after 2 years.,5
Tiddliwinks Sweet Safari Fitted Sheet in White/Pink,Purchased this for my new granddaughter's crib.  It was just what we expected.I would recommend this for a sweet little girl.,4
Wimmer-Ferguson Clip and Discover Shapes Take Along Toys,What can I say? This one has been a hit since she was maybe 4 or 5 weeks old. She's now 4 months and still gets a kick out of these great take-along toys. She has had whole conversations with the cat and the baby while staring at them intently making a whole range of facial expressions.,5
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I was very doubtful, but the Squatty Potty make the &#34;going&#34; better - more complete. It allowes your body to do what it does naturally.",5
Bright Starts Grab and Stack Blocks,"My son seems to like these blocks. They are bright, big and soft, which is perfect for my 4 month old.",5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",This product is like a built in babysitter. My grandaughter who is 7 months loves it! She will stay in it for an hour at a time. The quality is great and the price on amazon can't be beat.,5
"Britax B-Safe Base Kit, Black",Bought this for my car so that my wife and i can alternate taking and picking up our child from day care.Works just like the one that comes with the b-safe car seat. No complaints!,5
"Itzy Ritzy Infant Car Seat Cover, Urban Jungle Blue","This item is NOT allowed by any manufacturer. They all void the warranty. Anything that goes between the baby and the straps, other than light clothing, is dangerous. It can cause compression and eject your baby from the seat. Also, if your car or a car that hit you were to catch fire this seat will not protect the baby. It meets no federal safety requirements and could be a matter of life and death for your child. Please use your brain and do not use these!",1
"Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, Green",Stays in place well and my 16 month old has no problem stepping up on it or using it as a seat.  Lightweight enough that she can move it on her own.,5
MEG Original Minky Dot Baby Blanket Gray/White,I love the modern design. (I have been looking for anything grey/black/white to match with my stroller & carseat). Love the quality fabric as well.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Although my baby likes being in the Jumperoo, she does not love it like she does herGraco Baby Einstein Discover & Play Activity Center. The Activity Center is still her favorite probably due to the variety of toys all around. She's not so excited by the toys on the jumper. A funny side effect of spending time in the Jumperoo is that when she's not in it, she still tries to jump including while she is sitting... So she bobs her head up and down as if jumping and it looks like she's jamming to a cool song :-)",4
"Eddie Bauer Harness, Girl Monkey","I'm a mom of 20 months old boy/girl twins.  Bought this Monkey (for my daughter) and the Bear (for my son) for our first international trip to China.  They were used quite a bit at the airport and other public places throughout our trip.  Since my twins were still a bit young and didn't walk with a sense of direction, they fought against the leash and fell often.  But my husband and I were at least able to contain them within reach.  Once they're a bit older, I believe they will be even more useful!  My twins love walking around wearing the monkey and the bear once I tug the leash in the pocket.  A must have for twin parents to travel!",5
Combi Cosmo DX Lightweight Stroller in Malibu,"This stroller is great for our small car. It's very light and easy to fold. At first, we're not sure how to fold it, so we went to YouTube for video instruction. It's super easy. The adjustable reclining design is great. Our baby can sleep in there, very comfortable! And we love the color!",4
"Luvable Friends Infant Pillow Case, Traditional Blue Print","Nice soft pillowcase for the price. I am ordering our third one so that should tell you something. The only complaint I have is that because this is made of a knit fabric, it does not remain rectangular. My son stretches it all out while sleeping and it ends up completely twisted (with seams ending up partially in middle of the pillow.. you get the idea). Oh, and washing/drying the cases doesn't restore their shape. They remain forever twisted. This does not affect functionality, it's just less than tidy looking.UPDATE - It's several months later and all three of these cases have not held up well to normal toddler use and washing.  None of them are rectangular; You can't even fold them.  Since they are all stretched out and askew, they shift around during the night.  My son then gets frustrated with them and takes them off.  This means the actual pillow is getting drooled on night after night and needs to be washed often.  Now the pillow stuffing is lumpy and I'm back online buying a memory foam travel pillow.  I was thinking maybe if these cases had velcro, a zipper or snaps to close off the open end, this might solve our problem of him removing the cases constantly.  I'd add buttons, but I'm afraid of the choking hazard.  Anyway, it really should be this difficult to cover a pillow, right?I initially really liked these because they were a great bargain and were inexpensive.  However, these are not worth the hassle after they get stretched out and twisted.  I'm reducing to two stars.",2
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","What can I say? It's cute, shipped fast, tells me the temperature of the water and entertains my son! It makes prepping his bath much easier and faster in the evenings",5
"green sprouts Warming Plate, Sage","I wish I had found this product sooner. My son was already well into self-feeding and finger foods when I purchased a few of these, but I got them primarily because we have no microwave. I have tried all sorts of other ways to re-heat his food, and this is probably the most convenient and simple way I have found so far. I heat water in my kettle, and--very carefully--pour it through the very tiny opening in this plate. Liquid food heats up quickly, though finger foods need more stirring and time.I do wish the opening were larger. But it's not the end of the world.I bet if I had this plate when my son was just starting out on solids, I would have used it all the time.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Fuel Cell Insulated Bag, Black/Silver","Cute print, very good quality, excellent features, a lot bigger than I needed. Takes up too much room in the diaper bag. Probably better if used for a lunch box versus a bottle cooler.",4

BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,Our little girl LOVES this potty and is so comfortable on it sometimes she doesn't want to get off.  I highly recommend.,5
The First Years Swing Tray - Portable Booster Seat Blue &amp; Aqua,"I bought this for my 2 year old who wants to sit at the big boy table.  It lasted 2 weeks of him taking the back off and sliding the seat part half off.  I did not use the tray so the hole to hold the tray was left open.  Needless to say that is where he stashed crumbs.  I really like the design and the ease of the straps, but it falls apart to easiely.  I think I am going to buy the Fold & Go Booster from Safety First.",2
Little Partners Learning Tower - Natural,"I was reluctant to but the learning tower because of the price.  However, the reviews I read here and elsewhere convinced me to go ahead and get it.  I have not been disappointed.  It is well made, sturdy and makes time in the kitchen so more more fun for both me and my child.",5
Chicco Lil Piano Splash Walker,"Our baby was four months old when we purchased the walker. Even though only two toes touched the floor, he was still able to scoot around and enjoy the music and lights. The entertainment board (&#34;piano&#34;) offers a variety of colors, sounds, and activities. I highly recommend this product.",5
Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,It is good for the price.  You get what you pay for with mattresses.  We plan on having it for a long time so I wish I had spent a little more for one that fits the crib better.  Slight rounding where it meets the corners.,3
"Skip Hop Zoo Storage Bins, Ladybug",This is perfect for organizing toys. It fit inside my kids' toy box. I also used one outside the toy box. Too cute!,5
Sassy 12 Count Disposable Changing Pads,I didn't realize that these are rather small. I bought them when I travelled internationally with my 6 month old and he was  rather big for them. So ended up only being under his bum as opposed to his whole body which I would have liked,4
Sophia Mini Siderail Toddler Bed Conversion Kit Finish: Espresso,"All the questions were about how I liked this toy and its educational value. It's not a toy, it's a bed rail for a crib. It's not educational, it's, once again, a bed rail.It fits the sorelle sophia crib perfectly (the one made in china with the metal under the mattress) and was easy to put together. Thanks!",5
"NUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Pack","DONT waste your money1- they are WAY too small for any nursing mom2- they are too stiff and won't sit right in any bra3- they are itchy, rough and uncomfortable4- they don't absorb more than a teaspoon before you need a changeI would give these pads a zero if I could!",1
Nuby 7 oz. Cup With Valveless No-Spill Spout,"My 13-month old ends up covered with milk every time she uses this cup.  After the first few times using it, she figured out that you can press on the top and the milk will come out the sides.  The top also does not stay in place, so the valve is always off center.  This is the only sippy cup I have ever just thrown in the garbage...",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Stay clear of this bathtub... I cleaned mine and in all of the crevises, MOLD had started top grow. The suction cups are so tight that if you fill up the tub and try to move it, you cannot lift it up. You have to take this tub apart every other day to keep it clean and safe for your child. My daughter also has a hard time laying on the mat. She keeps sliding down and I have to keep picking her back up. Buy a different bathtub for your child.........VERY DANGEROUS",1

Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,I had a six hour lay over at the airport with my two and a half year old son.  This strap was perfect for my trip.  He loved riding and seeing everything and he even took his nap while being strolled in his own car seat.  This was a simple yet wonderful invention.,5
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","Easy to hold on to, grandson loves the characters because he loves the movies. These are his favorite cups he's 2 1/2years old.",5
"Moby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Sand","My baby loves to be held in the Moby Wrap.  It was particularly useful in the early months, when she was not comfortable in a ""baby bjorn""-style carrier.  She slept in it really well, probably because she was held so tightly against me.  She is now old enough to alternate between this and a ""baby bjorn""-type carrier.  The carrier is great for when I want her awake and alert, but the Moby Wrap is good for longer wearings, when I want her to nap.Practical tips:1.  There's a lot of wrapping required, but you get the gist of it quickly.2.  It fits me fine (5'4"", 130 lbs), but my husband is 6'2"", 200 lbs, and the ends of it barely tie for him.3.  Put it on before you get in the car (without the baby of course), as you don't want to be wrapping yourself in a dirty parking lot.  It is very long and the ends drag on the ground as you are performing ""the wrap.""4.  The fabric is a kind of jersey knit, which is very warm.  This might not be comfortable in the middle of summer or a very warm climate.5.  It shrinks a little in the dryer, but seems to stretch right back out to its previous size once you put it on and stick a baby in it.6.  Moby gives instructions on how to make your own Moby Wrap from your own fabric if you don't want to purchase their product.  But you know what?  For the amount of fabric I'd have to buy, this price is really not bad.  Plus, this version has a pretty little modern design on it that makes it fun to wear.Overall, I can say I've gotten my money's worth out of this item.  There are other baby items I've purchased for a similar price and not used nearly as much.  I'm glad I bought this!",5
Baptismal Shell Brass,"Make sure that you are purchasing the all-brass baptismal shell, and not the white ceramic one with a gold cross glued into it.  There is a seller who seems to have latched the listing for their ceramic product onto this listing by mistake.  Regarding the brass baptismal shell, it is of excellent quality, and comparable to other shells available at double the price.  It has three ball-feet so that it can stand level, and is solid brass --not plated-- and has the fine weight of a brass product.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","I bought this 3 pack because it was cheaper than buying them individually. I have a 12 month old and a newborn. Both boys. My 12 month old loved being in these straight jackets. I bought these hoping the newborn would like them too. Yup, he does. It helps him sleep and gives him the feeling he's still in the womb. I recommend these to all newborn babies.",5
Pair of Panda Baby Booties Foot Rattles,Go with a different brand.  I ordered these and one of the socks was missing a rattle?!?! Now I can't use them!  You think this would have been caught in the packaging. Very disappointed.,1
Munchkin Cleaning Brush Set,I use this to clean my toddler bottles. I love all the different sizes; useful for cleaning bottles and my breast pumping accessories.,5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Gate Check Bag,"We have two strollers, one of which is the Britax B Agile and the other is a Stokke Xplory.  I hoped this universal bag would fit both, but it didn't fit the B Agile.  Since that's our go-to stroller for travel, I needed to return this and buy the Britax brand one specifically designed for our stroller.  We have the Lionheart carseat bag, though, which matches this bag, and we like the carseat bag just fine.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","Good thing for a newborn. My daughter just sleeps in it through the night and can't get her hands out, which means no wake-ups. Plus it is soft and warm. I wish Halo has the bigger size with swaddle feature as well.",5
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I absolutely love this stroller!!! I did a crazy amount of research before deciding on this model. I was also considering the versa, but the gt won because of its size. We have a decent sized apartment and a small car. This folds in and out of them like a breeze! If we have another child we'll reconsider the versa, but every review I saw said how it folds bigger and is heavier.If you're considering a city mini, spring for the gt model. My friend has the standard model and wishes she had the gt for the tires, and handlebar. They both handle like a dream, though.",5
"Skip Hop Set of 2 Zoo Bookends, Dog","Since I read other reviews I knew this would not be a good bookend, but i still wanted it so I finally decided to buy. This was bigger than I thought. It's about 7.5 inch. I love how cute this owl is! Looks great in my nursery room! Cute decor item, not so good bookend.",5
"Gund Baby Lena Lamb Musical Toy, Jesus Loves Me",The item did not work as discribed so I returned for a refund. I would not buy this product again.,1

"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round",o I never write reviews but feel I must on this product.  My husband and I have purchase MANY products trying to capture our infants hand and foot prints including lots of different ink products on the market and other impression material.  This stuff is AWESOME!Some pointers I recommend: You MUST knead the material for 2-3 minutes as directed.  I used books on either end when rolling it out to make it perfectly even and a marble rolling pin (don't even bother with the one in the kit).  When you roll it out roll only in one direction to help keep it from sticking to the rolling pin. When you make the impression I put Johnson and Johnson baby lotion on the hand and foot first to keep it from sticking to the material (make sure you apply enough)!  The best part is even if you mess up you can re-roll the material as many times as you need (we did about 6-7x for the hand print!)  About 12 hours into the drying process peel it off the tin foil and flip it over for the other 12 hours to dry (and keep it from curving in).  If you use your material wisely you actually have enough to make a hand and foot print from the package.  I also managed to turn the frame right side up and put both the hand and foot print in the designated spot along with our infants picture.  It looks AMAZING and Pearhead is wonderful to work with!!If the product does not come out of the package difficultly (sticking to the sides) then it's probably no good.  (I bought 6 ornament impression kits as well and they were drier and made awful prints.  I called the company and they sent me out 6 replacements for FREE)!  They also did that for the ink kit we bought that didn't work out as well.  This company is awesome..can't rave about them enough!  o I never write reviews but feel I must on this product.

Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,"After looking at user reviews on several sites, I purchased this airplane restraint for my four year old daughter, who weighs 38 pounds. Unfortunately, we were not able to test the product in flight because once I unpacked it, I read in the package inserts that there is a height limit of 40 inches (which my daughter exceeds). I reviewed the manufacturer's website as well as Amazon's and never saw anything about an upper height limit. The return process was fast and painless and the product did arrive prior to estimated date of receipt.",3
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","We own two of them.  We use these CONSTANTLY as we go out.  They are the biggest lifesavers when we go out to eat.  They are easy to pack up as they fold up really nicely in themselves, they are very, very durable, they don't stain (easily), and they clean up really nice.  They are just spectacular.  We've bought more for a few shower gifts for people, telling them that this is one of those things you won't realize that you need until you have kids and then use it.  Everyone we've given it to loves them, too.",5
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","This is a good value of bibs in so many colors for the price.  The problem is I'm already having trouble getting them all the way around my newborns neck.  I can still get them on by just the tips of the velcro now so I know they aren't going to last us much longer.  I wish I would not have bought these now because I'm going to have to turn right around and buy another set.  Additionally, they are not very soft and I don't even like wiping under her mouth with it because it seems like it would be too rough on her skin.  Personally, I wouldn't want them rubbed on my skin.  It is true that liquid does not go through to the clothes and they do not make that crinkly sound of some waterproof bibs so that is nice.  If only the neck straps were longer it would be a great product.Also, you might think you'll be able to match these to a lot of outfits, but my little girl does not have all of those wild colors in her wardrobe so they clash.  I just have to reserve the light pink and white bibs for when we take her out of the house so she matches.",3
"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Lightweight Knit Wearable Blanket, Blue, Large",Keeps my son nice and warm.  He moves all around his crib at night and I was afraid to use blankets.,5
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary",These sippy cups are very hard to come by where I live. I bought them for my son when he was learning how to drink from a cup. I like the fact that they are smaller than most sippy cups (meaning they hold less). Which worked well for us as he didn't drink much to being with. The soft spout which the child controls and great for starting out. My one complain is that once the get a bit older and realize the soft spout disperses the liquid everywhere if you push it onto your high chair tray. Made for a bit of a mess. I would definitely recommend this cup for babies just starting out with a sippy. cup.,4
Munchkin Baby Laundry Bag,"Great idea, very well made. I keep it fastened to my daughter's changing table. I just wish it was a bit bigger. Fills up pretty quick. I use it as more of a laundry hamper than a laundry bag. This idea saves some space!",4
Green Sprouts I Play 2-Pack Pacifiers 0-6 months BPA Free - Pink/Green,"These were perfect because they went with the theme of my niece's nursery, but unfortunately she never took a pacifier. :(",5
"Kushies &quot;On the Go&quot; 2 Pack Wet Bag, Green  (Patterns and Colors May Vary)","These were okay bags- at first. The size is very good for travel, the colors are cute, and it doesn't smell.However- if you leave wet cloth diapers in them for more than a couple hours, it begins to seep wetness all over the bag.But these bags do not hold up. After 8 months of very gentle use (I don't use them more than once or twice a month, and never put them in the dryer) the drawstring hasn't closed without a struggle for ages, the colors have faded a little, and the inner plastic lining is coming off in the wash.If you need a good wet bag, either spend the extra $$ for a better quality bag- or do what I and my friends do now and just use a plastic grocery bag, it works better and its cheap as free!",1
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"This is a really nice little mobile and attaches/moves easily but is still sturdy. For our little one in particular the issue was she always wanted to get to the little animals... until it got to the point where she was tall enough to rip them off. Even 10 months after animal removal these little guys are still some of her favorites (especially the giraffe which we have to wash often as the feet seem to be the ultimate teethers for front, canines and molars). It has nice melodies and a very soft light if you choose that option. Battery life is middle of the road.",5
Especially for Baby Steam Sterilizer,The sterilizer is hard to use with Dr Brown bottles b/c of the height of the bottles. I have to do the bottles and nipples separately and it tends to leak a lot of water.,2

"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I looked for these in every store and finally found them on here after I was told they dont even make them anymore. They got here sooner than anticipated.  They were in perfect condition. They cost more than I expected them to but they were so worth it.,5
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,"First of all, the cover fits the Boppy well. It's snug and durable. But unfortunately it doesn't protect the Boppy from liquids any more than any other cover. I tried using it by itself and pee got through without any problems. Then I added an additional cover over it and spitup got through both covers. It's cheaper than some other covers, so on this aspect, it's worth it. But don't get it expecting it to protect the Boppy from any inevitable baby wetness related problems.",3
Maymom Tubing Set For Medela Freestyle Breastpump,"Like others, I was suspicious if the tubing will fit my free style breast pump because of some negative reviews on this product. I decided to give it a try since I have amazon prime (two-way free shipping).I received the package within two days and I have been using it since then.  No problem whatsoever.  I could do double and single pumping with the little part it included.  I also tried just keeping the other side plugged in to do single pumping - it worked as well.Happy with the purchase, and saved me $$.  Two thumbs up. No need to return.",5
Green Chambray Folding Hamper,"The review by Janine Flood took the words right out of my mouth!  I washed this in cold also.  I don't remember now, but I may have even air dried it.  If I did dry it, it was on low heat.  It shrank so much, I can only get the velcro to reach around the wood frame on one side a tiny bit with much effort.  It's enough to hold it on though.  I've managed to use it for 7 months so far and I do like it alot.  The mesh bag is great.  I keep the cloth top flipped open unless I have company.  It would be a pain to have a seperate cover to open each time or leave lying around.",3

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","got this gate last night, opened up the box and had it installed in my 2y.o's doorway in 15 min(and that's because i'm a slow reader). very easy to use, should keep my kid in her room so that when she wakes up in the morning, she wont leave her room and tumble down the stairs.  seems to be fairly tight in the doorway, but this gate also comes with these caps, that you can screw into your door jamb for more security than just pressure.so far so good.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Extra Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","We needed a baby gate and this one fit the bill in terms of length and quality. You need to buy the extentions based on how wide of base you have, but most of the different products out there require a base because they dont build them very wide. Our son loves to stand up against the gate and pull at it. So far, he has not been able to pull it over or get through. You get your money's worth and definitely the best one for the price. Others recommended this one and I will agree with them.",4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I went back and forth about this one and the Britax frontier.  I have the Britax Marathon for my son already.  It's a great seat for the $$ I really, really mean that but we are taking a chance with the buckle as it is a good 2"" shorter then the Britax as I went to the store to measure.  I went as far as emailing Graco to see if they had any plans to change it and suggested the googled their own product to see their ONE MAJOR FLAW!  Anyway long and short my 95% sized 4.5 year old fits FINE in it NOW but could be an issue in the future.  I moved him from the Marathon to this and my 2 year old to the Frontier and all are happy.  On a good note I love the cup holders and nooks to put toys.  I can't wait to turn it into the next stages vs buying a new seat and if you all wait you will find this seat on sale for $130 or less!  Target, Amazon and a few others will have sales on this seat so just keep looking.  Hope this helps as all the reviews I read before this DID!  Good luck!",4
"Kiddopotamus Cradler Adjustable Head Support for Newborns to Toddlers, Ivory Teddy Bears",Not a good fit for car seats. Causes child's head to be rigidly held in one position and makes her very uncomfortable. If the inside had been softer it might work better.,2
Philips Avent 6 Pack BPA Free Classic Variable Flow Nipple,"It was as the description said... my baby love it and the quality is good, in the box is 3 nipple by package",5
(1) Buckle Guard Car Seat Belt Button Cover in BLACK,"Very simple to use and works great on side button seat belt locks,  Top button locks are a little more difficult because the cover has to be removed to access the button.  Not a big deal, but taking it on and off will probably wear out the plastic hinge.",4
"Carter's Forest Friends Musical Mobile, Tan/Choc","It matches to room decor, but it stopped working in less than 30 days!The music plays for too little time.I don't recommend it at all, really disappointing.",1
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Ballerina Layette Set with Gift Box, Pink",Bought it for my granddaughter 8 weeks old but she won't be wearing it for several months.  Ok quality and look forward to seeing it on her.,4
"Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers, Pink Dot",So cute!  Fits on the closet clothing bars well.,5
Carter's Cuddle-Me Fleece Blanket - Pink Dot,My granddaughter's blankie at MawMaw's house.  Durable and comes out of the dryer looking like new.  Would definitely purchase again.,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Happy Giraffe Bouncer,"We received this as a gift for our baby, and she has loved it ever since I put her in it at about 1.5 months.  It's been fun to watch her figure out that the bouncer moves when she moves, and more recently that she can make the toys rattle when she bats at or grabs onto them.  She is big for her age (4 months) and still fits comfortably in it.Pros:  This item is easy to put together and take apart for transporting and it is lightweight, making it very portable.  It's also pretty sturdy and has a ""harness"" strap so I feel comfortable leaving the baby in it.  We set it down wherever we are and it usually occupies the little one for 20-30 min, or maybe more if she chooses to take a nap in it.  The toy bar is removable so you can use it like a little seat if you want.  There is also a vibrating function, though I have not used this personally.  The biggest pro is that our baby seems to love it, and it is one of the more reasonably priced bouncers with all of the basic functions.Cons:  The base is made of metal rods that curve around, but the problem is that they are wider than the bouncer itself (in the photo it's where the green rubber covers the white metal rods) so we, and anyone else who visits, are constantly tripping over the bouncer if we're not careful.  The worst is when we get the metal part caught between our toes and then trip - I honestly thought I broke my toes a few times... ouch!  It seems that a solid base design or at least some panels to cover the sides would be much safer since I'm not about to put this on an elevated surface to avoid tripping over it.  Another small con is that the middle ring plays sounds when you pull on it, but one of the four sound cycles is a little useless, and sounds kind of like very low growling (other sounds include a ""meow"", and 2 MIDI-sounding tunes).  Not a big deal, but I could do without it personally.Overall I would recommend this bouncer over some of the pricier models unless you are pressed for space and can't put it somewhere where it won't be a safety hazard!",4
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",We have 2 cars and this was perfect so that we didn't have to keep taking the base out and putting it in the other vehicle.,5
36 Pc Full Size Diaper Pins,Ordered these for decorations at a baby shower.  Was so cute. Folded napkins like diapers and used these pins. Then filled the diapers with nuts and mints.  The &#34;mom&#34; got to take them with her.,5
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation.Overall its a nice case for the money. Its very slim and sleek and fits the iphone like a glove. It doesn't add weight or size to the phone, like other cases do. So if you want some basic protection without adding bulk, this is the case for you. Combine this with a screen protector and you'll be protected against basic scratches from daily use. However, like most cases, this case probably won't protect your phone from a drop onto the sidewalk so just got to be careful!",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best gate. I first got ""Summer Infant Sure and Secure Extra Tall"" because of some of the negative feedbacks.But when I needed another door gate, I took a chance with so many positive feedbacks.and... yes, I really like this gate. If you know how to install properly, it should be pretty firm gate.The other gate is little hard to open for my wife and mom.But this is way to go!!!",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","I like this car seat; we have another Evenflo but got a second car seat for emergencies.I do have two complaints, if you will, about this particular model, though.  First, it's a tad bit difficult to snap in the bottom buckle that goes between their legs because it has to be clicked in perfectly straight.  Not the best when you're on the go, but isn't too big of a deal.The greater of the two complaints would be that the straps definitely dig into my two year old's neck.  So, we bought some little monkey protector things that velcro on around that part of the strap.  I would recommend these.",4
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl",,5
Carter's Child of Mine Mommy's Sweetheart Pink Bear Security Lovey Blanket,I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 weeks old because she was pulling her covers over her head. This was the perfect solution. She got her snuggles and I didn't worry about her suffocating.,5
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation, it's great quality, it's easy to install and to remove, i might buy one in a different color",5
Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"One day our little one started getting bruises all over the house and I went nuts buying safety bumpers.  This one was seemingly a bit pricey, and I didn't know how effective it would be but has ended up being one of my favorite purchases.  Can't tell you how many times this bumper guard has saved the head/face from a nasty bruise.  Worth it--especially if your kid ends up being super active! Was on craigslist and no one sells this stuff 2nd hand, probably b/c they give it to good friends/family instead!  BUY IT.  You won't regret it!",5
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"Used it all away until we ""went away"" with bottles. Like the use, little space it took and the bring color. Would recommend it.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","We have been using the Britax for our baby for a couple of months now with no problems.  Like the look and feel and our baby seems to be comfortable in it.  The one issue I do have is the fact that if installed in some cars, you need something (they suggest on their YouTube videos a rolled towel or floatie) to help the seat come to a level position.  Since Britax is suppose to be one of the safest car seats around, I would have expected them to have some mistake proofing built into their design or included with the seat to ensure proper installation instead of requiring customers to identify an additional item to obtain the correct position.  I luckily didnt have an issue in my car, but now know of others who have.",4
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","Cons: Its a very, very large seat; Must use two hands to adjust the bar.PROS: The 5 pt harness was really spaced well; The Latch system was EXTREMELY easy to use; The belt system was EXTREMELY easy to use; The material is easy to clean;",5
Munchkin Fire Ducky Spout Guard,"I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same!  What were these manufacturers thinking?!  The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..).  I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution.The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck!  All in all, this is a horrible product!",2
Snuggy Baby Large Wet Bag - Floral Fireworks,"This bag is a permanent resident in my diaper bag. It's the ideal place to keep messy bibs, wet clothes, cloth diapers, etc. away from everything else in there until I can get them home and into the wash. I think this bag's XL size would make it perfect for long trips, too, and/or moms with more than one child. The exterior fabric is so cute and unique; I like that other moms I know probably wouldn't have a similar bag. The interior is a waterproof lining that's not bulky. The biggest plus, though, is that it's well-constructed and seems really durable, with a smooth zipper and a handy little handle. I definitely recommend it!",5
"Carter's Forest Friends Hamper, Tan/Choc, 17 X 16 X 27&quot;",I love this hamper and it matches our Carter's Forest Friends Crib set perfectly!  Very sturdy and well made.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a dirty clothes hamper who purchased this particular crib set.  The colors matched true to those that appeared on my Mac Book Pro screen.,4
"Athena Nadia 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",The crib is very well made and beautiful...I was surprised that it seemed lighter than other furniture with the same espresso finish but still loved it and would recommend!,5
Houdini Stop Car Seat Chest Clip,"I purchase the Houdini strap so my 20 month boy would stay safely buckled in his car seat. It works perfectly! If your child pushes the harness buckle down towards the waist instead of leaving it closer to the chest area, this is the perfect item to buy. My son is once again strapped in safely - with his arms behind the harness!",5
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Fork Set,"I was worried about starting my child too early on metal cutlery, but starting at about 15 months we gave these a try and my little girl loved it!  She needed help with it of course, but the fat handles were great for her to hold onto, and the metal tines were much more effective at spearing food than any plastic fork.  Now at 18 months, we have to make sure all of her food is fork-friendly because she takes such pride in spearing her own food and feeding herself.  Bonus for me - her hands are always clean now!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","We have a very modern home and this didn't fit any of the three faucets we tried it on. Would have cost us more to return than it was worth, so we ended up giving it to a friend with an older home & she loves it.",2
"AppleCheeks Washable Swim Diaper (Size 2, Mojito)",This diaper works great. It is easy to use and does the job.  Even the blue one is kind of girly looking.,5
Infantino Wonder Whale Kicks and Giggles Gym,"I bought this for my son to go with his nautical-themed nursery. It is really adorable, but the part where you hang the toys is very unstable. If you hang more than one toy from it, it droops down so low it almost touches the mat. It's not really ideal for a small baby. We just hang one toy from it and use the other attachment hooks throughout the bottom, but the advertising is a bit misleading since they hang all four toys with no issue.",3
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"Use it everyday, my baby love the food.  Very easy to use, I totally recommend it. I love this product.",5

'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,"I love this sippy cup, & my son loves his new cup, We had this sippy for a week now, Unfortunately this  cup  ""Drips"" out liquid, Which is why it is 3star, But other then that so far  works great & it is the best on the market that I can find..  & The Handles Don't always line up right.. This Sippy easily could be 100stars:}, if Eco Vessels will put a mark on their cups for the lid & does something for the Drip leaks...  super Close to perfect & I am ordering 2nd one today..",3
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Black/Champagne","After my lightweight (11 lbs) Cybex gave in to NYC Streets and beatings from gateside plane checks, we needed a new umbrella stroller.I narrowed my search down to the MacClaran Quest, UppaBaby G-Luxe and Bumbleride Flite.Very happy with the Quest.  Easy fold & unfold, loads of room for my 2 year old, one hand recline is awesome.  Although not the lightest (13.1 vs. the 9.0 Volo), I LOVE the full recline - worth the extra few pounds to me.  My husband also thinks it is east to use.I live in NYC and have little space and time to fold/unfold/store and get my daughter in/out with bags/briefcase/groceries in hand.  Even if you live in suburbia, I think this is a perfect combo of larger strollers and umbrella strollers.More info for the detail-oriented readers:--Sturdier than UppaBaby G-Luxe.--G-Luxe harder to fold and has two hand, string recline.  Bulky seat padding makes it cumbersome.--Easiest umbrella stroller to navigate one-handed.  Not as easy as my large Teutonia, but better than other brands in its class.--Some people think the Quest five-point harness is too hard to undo.  For my crafty toddler, I rest assured she cannot undo the buckle.  Sure, it's an extra 3-5 seconds to undo it, but worth the peace of mind for me.--I could not find a retailer in a 75 mile radius who carried the Bumbleride Flite and went on YouTube to find demo videos.  Although it is sleek and has a few features more than the Quest (larger canopy and easier buckle), it still did not seem as user friendly as the Quest.--Downside of Quest is the canopy.  Even open, it is not large and does not shift down/adjust like my Cybex.  Personally, I was willing to concede on this for the full recline.  I can use a muslin receiving blanket or add-on canopy for sunny days.--The Quest wheels cannot lock when in fold position, so storing against a wall is hard (not an issue if you have more space), but I do not mind this for the features it affords my daughter.Happy stroller hunting!",5
Carter's Baby Boy's 2-Pack Gowns - Elephants - Newborn,"So, this is my first baby and I purchased a number of brands of newborn and 3 month clothing to see what he would like once he was home.  So far, Carters has been a favorite for him and for me.  Their clothing is soft, washes well and is easy to get on and off.  So, when I was advised to try gowns for night sleep because of their ease come mid-night diaper changes, I thought Carters would be ideal.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  The base of the gown where the elastic is located is SO tight!!!  Even sliding it up over a newborns legs was difficult and while I was changing his diaper the elastic was cutting off circulation in his waist.  I tried it one night and then both the gowns went into the donation bin.",2
"Ah Goo Baby The Diaper Pouch, Zoo Frenzy","This is so cute and functional, however the velcro that secures the flap is sewn on one way on horizontally on the bag and vertically on the flap, so it doesn't secure well and I've had it come open and things fall out :(. I think this may have just been a mistake when made, and if not for that huge inconvenience, I would have given it 5 stars.",3
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black",I recently got a new car and didn't want to mess up my seats with my girl's car seats.  In the past I had just used a towel to try to keep my seats looking nice.  These are SO MUCH BETTER!!  They are easy to install and really help cover my seats.  I like the &#34;lip&#34; edge on them that keeps snacks from getting everywhere.  Such a great purchase I'll be buying 2 more for my husband's new truck!,5

Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,I searched everywhere for these valves because my daughter liked to lose them... Super cheap and exactly what I needed!,5
"Jaq Jaq Bird Perfect Pouch Storage Bag, Roadway, Small, 2 Pack","These bags are handy. They are very cute and the big one is nice and large. I use them to keep clean, dry clothes in my diaper bag. Then when an outfit gets wet and messy I switch them out. The only thing to note is that they are stiff bags - not soft and easily bendable / foldable. This isn't necessarily a drawback but I just wasn't expecting it. They would work particularly well for flat items....or game pieces, markers etc. I also sometimes use them to toss in an ice pack and a snack.",5
Toy Story Toddler Sheet Set -2 Piece,my kids love toy story and were very excited to receive this bed set quickly and well packaged will order more,5
"Dreambaby Bump Belt, Black","This only worked so-so for me. Since I'm petite and very skinny, the elastic tabs that hold the belt down, away from the stomachare too long and loose for me. They do move the belt a bit lower down, but not enough.",3
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Expansion Gate,"I am surprised on all these bad reviews that I am reading.I have owned this gate for 3 years now, bought it in December 2003 when we had our first kid. We have a long and wide staircase and my wife was way too freaked out to even deliver without a gate installed.I remember researching for over a month which gate to get - and which would fit. I decided on this one.3 years later, I would buy it again. True, the template included is not too accurate. But then I am quite handy and I never trust templates.Also, you DO have to measure and install this on the dot so that there's no play on the top or bottom of the hinges.I mounted mine ON the ballusters at the top of our staircase. Now, 3 years later and 2 kids, it has still survived. Yes, as with all 4 gates in our house, the kids jump and hang on it. BOTH kids actually :) and they are now about 34 lbs each!The gate has not failed us and has not fallen over any of our kids, not even once. A couple of days ago, my youngest daredevil decided he had enough being restricted by the gate. So he dedicated himself to opening it. This is a 20 month old, 34 lbs, very strong and very determined baby.He DID manage to push it the other way, then proceeded to sit in front of it and push it until one of the hinges finally gave in.3 years, almost 70 lbs of kids constantly jumping on it. I don't think there are many gates that would have taken that kind of punishment and still work.So, overall I am happy and I just ordered replacement hinges for the broken ones. The hinges that were included in the original package were the plastic ones that a lot of people here call defective.Maybe I was lucky or maybe because I did not follow the temlpate I did install it correctly. Either way, once you've had a kid and had to assemble all the convoluted baby furniture and such, it becomes evident that incorrect/incomplete instructions are fairly common.",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","My Moby is an absolute necessity for me!  I've tried a few different carriers and, for comfort and extended wear, nothing compares!  I had to attend a conference when my baby was 2 months old and, knowing she likes to be held and that we would be having to run around a lot, the stroller wasn't going to be ideal.  She spent hours in the Moby throughout that week and my back never once felt the strain of wearing her even with all the walking - indoors and out - that I had to do.  She sleeps soundly in it even still at 7 months old and the option to secure her head is spectacular.  Some mommies told me they couldn't really use it past 6 months old max, but even though she is a very chunky monkey, I still have no problem using it and she loves it.  She feels so secure and the weight is distributed amazingly.  She weighs just under 20 lbs and I can comfortably wear her for hours.  It can get rather hot, especially since she is a heavy sweater.  I have worn her in hot weather, but not ""dead of summer"" kind of hot weather.  I recommend it highly to all my friends.  If I could've used it only for that one week at that conference, it would've been worth the price, but it's been such an amazing product throughout the months.  We were even able to do a haunted ghost walk in colder weather with her and she slept snug and warm the entire time.  When my friends watch me put it on, they all freak as it does look like it'd be the most complicated thing ever, but we found the hold she likes and use that and it's easy peezy.  If I know I'm going to want to use it, I will put it on before we leave so that I don't have to worry about it dragging the ground or dirty floors as I wrap it around me.  Then, I just get her from her carseat and put her right in when we get there.  You Tube has lots of videos that show how to wrap that helped me out.  And it's not touted as being a nursing wrap, but I have used it many, many times and nursed her at the same time.  Seriously, this is easily one of my favorite baby products ever made.  I have three slipped discs in my lower back and the Moby doesn't aggravate that at all.  My son's baseball season starts soon and I'm team mom and have no concerns about fulfilling my duties with my big girl in her Moby.",5
"Kalencom Laminated Buckle Bag, Multi Paisley Watermelon","I ordered this bag for my identical twin boys we are expecting. I have always loved Kalencom bags. They are durable and I love the fact that you can wipe them off. I was so disappointed when I received this bag. It did not look like it appears in the photos. The description may mention this, but I did not notice it. I thought the bag was black and white. When we opened the box it is black, brown, and white. Unfortunately, we returned it b/c we did not care for the brown. I will say we had a pleasant expierence with our return, prompt credit. Thank you Amazon",3
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Double Sided Wipes, Blue Emb.",I use these wipes to wipe my daughter's bottom. We currently use cloth diapers and picked these wipes because I liked the fleece side option.The fleece is soft (even after several washes and I do not use fabric softener). It is gentle on her bottom and it gets all the poop off. I use the fleece side to clean up the poop and the cotton side as a once over at the end.We also purchased the Organic Cotton Wipes from Amazon and use those if we are changing a diaper with just urine.Others have complained that these wipes repel water. I do not remember having any issues with repelling water but I did wash the  wipes before using them and I do not use fabric softener. Fabric softener will cause my cloth diapers to repel water and I wash these wipes with my cloth diapers.,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow",Only 6 months pregnant getting ready for baby had this placed in my bassinet just cuz. My kitten decided to use the bassinet as a littler box and urinated on it. The pad protected my number sheets and matress. I was very pleased to say the least. I ended up washing it on hot despite urine being sterile and the product label states to was on cold so it looks a little funny now but still soft.,5
Camp Grandma Green Photo Tote Bag,"I found this bag after looking high and low for a gift for my grandmother for Christmas. I settled on this and it was great.

The Door Guardian Childproofing Lock Colors: White,"I bought this for security instead of childproofing. Yesterday a man tried to kick in my front door while I was home alone. He was not able to gain entry and when the police arrived they said they thought it was because of this lock. It was super easy to install, however, I did use longer screws than what came in the package. I have had this lock installed since 2011 and never had a problem with it. I was very thankful to have had it yesterday and highly recommend it to anyone.",5
Jeep Trek Easy Travel Playard,"I thought this was a really cool play/travel yard when I first put it together.  I picked it out because it looked smaller and we are in a small place but then I realized a standard packnplay sheet would not fit properly. I was unable to find one by the Jeep brand so I used the standard packnplay sheet but it would come up and get bunched.  I also had the zipper get caught on the fabric after about a week so now it continues to catch. I stopped closing it up so that it wouldn't break off completely.I do really like the wheels on the one side. It's very easy to move around. The built in storage was cool too. However, my newborn daughter didn't seem to like laying in it much.  After a few minutes she would start fussing and she doesn't do that in her crib or seats.  It's not padded well so I guess it's just uncomfortable for her.  I really wish that Amazon had offered the free return shipping when I purchased this so I could have picked something else.",2
Sesame's Elmo Bath Mat 'splish Splash',"My son loves this bathmat. He had begun to crawl around the tub when we got it, and now he is able to stay still (and stand to get out) without slipping. I never experienced the bad smell that others have talked about in their reviews--perhaps this is a problem they fixed in later productions? It sticks well, the only downside is that since it is a clear mat, it does stain, and takes a little bit of extra work to clean. Also, the red dye ran a little bit, which makes the underside look a little gross, but a bath mat is going to grow mold I suppose.",4
Fisher-Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"I ordered the Rocker Swing as a gift for a new baby in the family, so I cannot review it first hand. However, the happy mom and baby, are raving about hours of swinging fun!  They are certainly enjoying the swing and are very happy with the gift.",5

Baby Einstein Discovering Water Rocker Seat,"I got this as a hand-me-down,so...  I wanted this seat so that my 2 yr old could share the new baby's toys (jealousy, you know).  My toddler LOVES it!  She loves anything with fish, of course:)  But, she really likes to sit in it, likes the music, thinks the vibrations are funny, is enamoured with the toys.But, I guess when I read rocker, I imagined it rocking the baby sort of like a swing.  That's not what this does, it simply can rock back and forth when the kick stand is down.  However, it really doesn't do that on the carpet, it's pretty stationary.  And it doesn't have bouncy wires like a bouncy seat.  It's not really flexible like a bouncy, it's very sturdy.  So, I'll update on the seat when the new baby comes.  But, for now, I'd say this is a cute seat, but I don't think I'd pay the full price just for a seat.  Maybe if I had more money:)",4
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",We really like these containers. They stay closed and we use them everyday for daycare. They are the perfect size for a baby just starting out on solids. We just ordered our second set. Soon we will need the bigger size.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",I have twin boys with really bad reflux.I tried propping up cosleeper mattress & they slid down to bottom.My friend swore by this & I brushed it off until I needed a slanted sleeping surface. I hated to separate my boys but they love this.It helps with reflux & if they spit up at least its going down & they dont choke on it. I dont need to keep them up as long watching them after feedings.They are snug in it & comfy & sleep like a dream in it.It is light & very portable.I recommend to anyone!!,5
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I'm a first time cloth diaper-er and haven't tried any other prefold. After doing my amazon review research these were my favorite and I haven't been disappointed. I use the jellyroll method with diaper pins and use a thirsties size 1 cover. There are very rarely any blowouts, and when there are it never gets on the clothes. They're very absorbent - our little girl hasn't needed night changes since maybe 4-5 weeks old (she's a light night soiler though). I don't even use a liner with them at night (which is only aggravating because they're bought, washed, and unreturnable. Oh well - backup wipes!).Most importantly they don't irritate her bum. I use Bordeaux's natural butt paste (green bottle) since it won't clog the cloth. On the rare occasion I have to use disposables, by 2 days of using the cloth any diaper rash starts fading and by 5-7 days its completely gone.I didn't bother with a toilet sprayer, I just rinse mine in the basement slop sink when I have a small load (2 days worth, approx 24-30 diapers). I also use rock the green detergent for them in bare naked babies which I love.We've been using these prefolds at 9 lbs (when her cord fell off) first we folded it in the back, we started front folding at 12 lbs. I think they might shrink a little because some do not fit the same as others, but its so subtle it's not an actual complaint, that's just why we started front folding. Even with a front fold she has yet to poo up past the back of the diaper (the back fold pocket would catch some of that before it went to disaster status).She's 15 lbs now and we still have to fold it down in the front - but not nearly as much. By 18 lbs I'm guessing well stop folding down. Just to give you a size reference.We also had the better fit infant size (purple edging, up to 16lbs) they were great too, these are still our main ones because they have a broader weight range (when rolling and pinning).Good luck!",5

Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I had to travel and didn't want to bring my large electrical breast pump. So I ordered this manual pump and I like it.Pros:- Easy to use - I like the letdown trigger- Easy to assemble- Easy to clean- Small for travel or a quick pump without pulling out the electric pumpCons:- Sometimes if I screw the bottle on too tight, the suction decreases. I unscrew by one thread and it seems to work better.",4
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count",This bottle system is wonderful.  The liners are so easy to use and they're even better for keeping everything clean and sterile.  They're wonderful!  My baby goes between bottles and being nursed and she has no problem at all.,5
Chicco Activity Baby Walker,"I received this item as a christmas gift for my son when her was six months old,but didn't open it until  My son absolutely loves this product. It's very interactive and the music that plays while he walking makes him want to walk with it more often.I have one big issue with this item which is why it lost three stars. The issue I have is that the hole where a child can put the balls in is big enough to where my twelve month old could reach his hand and arm into it. I was in the next room working on dinner when I heard this blood curdling scream from my son. I went in to find out why and found he had his arm up to his elbow stuck in the ball hole. It took me a bit to angle his arm out. His arm was red for about an hour or so and it also left a small bruise.",2
Econobum One Size Cloth Diapers Trial Pack (Mirror),Very economical. .. but not for us.  We switched to rumparooz and gave these away.,3
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",We have several gates that are used in verious areas of our house (day care) the quality of the gate is well known to us and this one was no exception.,5
Dwink Box - the Only True Universal Juice Box Holder,A great tool for a toddler with a juice box.  It keeps little man from squeezing the juice out of the box and he seems to like hanging on to the handles.,5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","This car seat has surpassed my expectations. I love that I can adjust the straps from the front. We had the Graco Snugride and it was a pain in the butt to adjust straps. My only word of caution is it's huge. If you have a 2 door car, you may want to consider another car seat. We have twins and have 2 of these seats and they take up our whole back seat. Other than that these are wonderful car seats to own and they are well worth the money. Our girls are almost a year old and we expect them to be able to use these seats until they are at least 3 years old.",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Bye Bye Buddy Blanket, Blossom",This bunny lovey is soo cute.  It's so soft and my daughter loves it!  I would love to have a few more!,5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These brushes are perfect for cleaning the reusable starbucks straws! But that's all I can say, I haven't used them for anything else and they are just for cleaning straight straws. They come in a package of four and I've only used one so far. Looks like the price is worth it for how long these brushes will last me :)",5
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,It is just what they wanted for their new bundle of JOY. They wanted the side to side swinging. Not the forward and back.,4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","My 4 month old son has been teething like crazy, but does not like the standard teething rings. Finding something that he can chew on that is safe, and appealing has been a challenge - however, this product has solved my problem! I can put frozen fruit such as bananas or peaches in it, without having to worry about him choking or getting it all over his hands. This allows the soothing coolness and the taste of the fruit at the same time. Compared to other brands or in store deals, the price was great. I've already recommended this product to several of my other mommy friends. (:",4
Spiderman Teether Friends,My 7 month old grandson absolutely loves this teether. He chews on the rubber hands and also on the head and feet. His older brothers love that it is Spiderman. I had to order a second so there is always a clean one. Also my daughter loves that this teether can go into the washing machine.,5
Malden Nursery Parade Baby Metal Picture Frame,"great product! Very good quality, solid design! Came in great condition! Highly reccomended to those looking for a nice baby frame.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is our family's favorite teether! She is easy for tiny hands to grip on to, and her hooves get back to the molars, so she's perfect for older babies too!  Our Sophie has survived two babies and yes, she has faded, but she just looks well-loved.  No rubber odor.  Well worth the $$.",5
Nano Highchair,Love this chair for our apartment.  We live in the city and have little space and this high chair is perfect.  It folds flat and easy to wipe down.  We've used it with both of our boys now (1.5 and 3.5 yrs) and has held up great.  They sit back a little reclined in the seat but not bad.  The tray is easy to clean.  You can remove all the parts for additional cleaning but not the easiest of tasks.,4
Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),My daughter loved this toy when she got it. It worked great the first time she used it but that was also the last time. The next day she tried to turn it on but it wouldnt so I thought she might of left it on so I changed the batteries but still nothing.,1
"Baby Trend Expedition Jogger, Vanguard",Very happy with it so far. I walk every where with it. My baby sits comfortly in it and can sleep just fine. I jogged a few times. Just have to make sure front wheel is lovked other wise it shakes. Rides smoothly and i have taken it on rough terran. It did okay. Glad it has bicycle tire wheels.,4
"Kathy Ireland Home 4 Piece Infant Crib Set, Chocolate Mint","I love this for my baby's room but wish I had had the option to purchase the pieces separately.  I hated to spend the money on the bumper pads since I absolutely will not put them in her crib but we got creative and used the bumpers to make a window valance, that way we didn't have to purchase the separate valance!",4
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,"Do not buy this.  After using it for a few months, it burst in my daughters mouth.  It's obviuosly scary  not knowing what the goo is and if it's harmful or not since she definitely swallowed some.  See other reviews and you'll notice I'm not the first person this happened to.  I'd advise you to buy a different teether.",1
Fisher-Price Apptivity Gym for iPhone &amp; iPod Touch Devices,"It doesnt support my iPhone 5! BOO!! I bought this because I was going to use it with my phone, but iphone 5 does not fit",2
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller, Red","First of all hats off to amazon for fast free shipping. I had the stroller a day and a half after ordering online and selecting the free shipping option.As for the stroller, I love, love this stroller.  I have a three year old and a five month old. My three old is tall and fits very comfortably in the seat. The baby fits great too with the seat reclined back a bit. The assembly is so easy. I had my three old helping me put the wheels and canopy on (that's all you have to do).  I am amazed by how light this stroller is and how easy it is to push. I have been taking it on limestone/ small gravel trails and it pushes with a breeze. I love the adjustable handle. I am short and hubby is tall. We are able to switch back and forth with ease.  The basket underneath the seats is very large. It would be hard to get a full size diaper bag in but if you have a smaller bag it would not be very difficult.  You can get in the storage basket from the side or the back.  The wheels on this stroller are great. They are like a jogging tire but a little smaller and forever air tires.  The canopies are great. Very large. Overall, I am so happy I got this stroller. I looked for about a year and was not so sure about spending $600 on a stroller but I am so glad I did it. It is hands down 100 times better than any other double stroller out there.  My husband is even happy about the stroller. He loves it too.",5
Texas Longhorns Sippy Cup Set,"We live in Colorado, and so I do my best to show my Texas pride whenever possible.  Yep, that means making sure my kids are often decked out in burnt orange too.  These sippy cups help me do just that.  They're really very durable and very, very easy to clean (don't forget the little plastic piece in the lid).  I'm very pleased with how well the printing has held up to frequent drops, bangs, and dishwasher cycles.  They're also a great size for little hands (my daughter is now 16 months and we've had these for maybe 5 or 6 months now).  I'm actually about to order another set to replace other sippy cups that have proven way too hard to clean or leak.",5
Evenflo Dual Electric Breast Pump,I had to purchase a new pump on the fly because my Avent pump died at work. SO I got this one because it was cheaper than the Avent single pump. This pump was recommended by friends and I have to say that so far it has not disappointed me. The suction is fantastic and it's very quick....10-15 versus the 30-40 minutes with the Avent pump. Sometimes it's ok to spend less money and get a good product than to spend more money on a product that is all brand name. I would recommend this to others :),5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",Wonderful product... My little girl will be soo comfy and cozy on the go!..Love the fact that its waterproof! Fits prefect in my infant carrier!,5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary",Great for twins due to having 4 slots instead of the normal 3!  I have 2 and I use then both when traveling or just out and about.,5
Euro-Baby Fastfold Fts Black,"Looks good in theory, but I think too big for my 14-month-old.  However, stroller enthusiasts rave about this, and I have been advised to hang on to it until my son gets older.  It does look like a very comfortable seat, and it is certainly great to push.  Not much of a basket though, and the canopy and recline are non-existent.  So probably good for quick in-and-out-of-the-car deals.UPDATE: My son is now 18 months old and has grown into it.  It is lightweight, compact, and great to keep in the car for quick trips.  The steering is excellent - I can push it with one hand while walking beside it.  Even though I'm shopping for a double now, I'll definitely keep this on hand.",4
"RaZbaby RaZ-Pak Formula and Snack Container, Transparent Blue","I really like to use these containers for formula... I no longer spill half of the powder every time I try to make my son a bottle. I can also see how these containers will grow with him. My only disappointment was the colors shown are not the colors I recieved. Instead of clear containers I recieved translucent blue containers with orange writing. Not a deal breaker, I just wish they were clear.",5
"Gerber Washcloths, Gorilla, Boy, 6-Count","These washclothes are way too thin. I washed them immediately with a load of my daughter's clothes and everything ended up with pink stains on it. To say I was furious is an understatement, the load of laundry was all new clothing for her and everything was ruined. Don't buy this.",1
Bright Starts Petals and Friends Activity Gym,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She has played with this so many times that I surprised it is still working.,5
Eddie Bauer Broadmoor Diaper Bag,I bought this bag for my son who is now 15 months. It's perfect for downsizing a diaper bag. We no longer need to pack bottles etc so this has been working great for us. Worth the purchase!,5
Sunshine Systems LEDGP14 GlowPanel 14 Watt LED Grow Light,"I bought two Glowpanels from Sunshine systems and one stopped working after two months of use.  I sent it back to the company and they refused to give me a refund or send me a replacement panel.  They said the unit was discontinued at the beginning of the year, but even after I sent a receipt they did not replace the panel.  I'm disappointed I spent so much money for something that laster for two months and won't buy anything from Sunshine Systems again.",1
"Philips AVENT 2 Pack BPA Free Decorated Toddler Cup, 12+ Months, 9 Ounce, Styles and Designs May Vary","March 25, 2011:  I ordered these cups for my 1 year old daughter because they can hold 9 ounce of liquid and they have handles, or that is what I thought.  I also liked the adorable designs they had on them.  When I received the cups I was very surprised, because they were plain and didn't have handles.  They were also only 5 ounce cups.  It is like someone put the 6+ month cups into 12+ month packaging.  The packaging even said 9 ounce on there.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out another set.  I am hoping this time they send me the right cups.Update - March 26, 2011:  Less than 24 hours ago I was chatting with a customer representative from Amazon.com about the above-mentioned issue and I can happily report that they mailed me the right cups overnight!  It is a great product and very cute.  My daughter can hold unto the handles and lift the cup.  Also, the valve can be taken out for kids who are more advanced.  The cup can be taken apart so it is easily washable.  The lid is great!  I am very happy with Amazon.com because of their fabulous customer service and Avent because this is truly a great product!!!",5
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,"My milk came in full force when my son was three days old. This was my first child so I had no idea what I was doing when choosing a pump.  My husband ran to the store and bought this pump since I hadn't decided on one yet.So far I have had this pump three months and it works well. Since we are a Military Family and are in the processes of moving (soon to be three times in 8 months) the fact that this pump runs off batteries as well as a plug is a great feture. I did have to use this pump a couple times a day for a week or two and it held up quite well.It is a little loud, but my son sleeps through anything. My sister in law gave me a Medela and that was when I really noticed the sound. The Medela was a little faster when it came to pumping, but it wasn't that big of a deal. If you only have to pump a little this is a good pump. I would highly recomend it. However if you work full time I would recommend going with a Medela or something of that nature. Being able to have a double pump would make things easier.",4
"American Baby Company Twin Pack 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Crib Sheet, Natural","I love these sheets. They're wonderfully soft, cuddly, and, due to their slight stretch, very easy to put on a crib mattress. These are 5 star sheets with one glaring problem. They smell horrible. They're packaged in some very, very stinky vinyl. I literally washed them three times and one of them still smelled very strongly, while the smell on the other had faded for the most part. So gross. What bothers me most of all is that these are organic and they still package them in toxic material. Well, hello! Consumers informed enough to buy organic in the first place know/care about the dangers of vinyl. Give me a break. I know the can package using a different material, because I ordered some organic cotton pillowcases that came in a completely unscented bag with recycling code 5 on it. Buy at your own discretion, but be prepared to wash the bejesus out these things.",3
Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress,"This mattress was a great purchase, the price was right and it's very convenient to not have to go to the store for this big lug. Fit into the crib (Graco Lauren crib by LaJobi) perfectly and the baby sleeps very well. No complaints, we are happy!",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",i got exactly what i was hoping for. it is light weight and easy to assemble and get around with,4
"Trend Lab Ultimate Diaper Bag, Brown/Blue","This diaper bag is amazing! We actually have two! As the mother of a 16 month old, this bag has been great as it has plenty of pockets of different styles, matching changing pad, insulated bottle pockets, a hook for keys, a padded strap, it zips shut, and has lots of room.  My husband likes that it is black (or silver- we have two) but I like the colored accent trim and inside linining.  I would definitely suggest this bag.",5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,This does not work at all. It barely keeps up on the wall. You have to hang it on the railing or get extra hooks for it.I like it because it does keep everything in place and dries up the toys fairly quickly. But the fact that the suction cup does not work is most annoying.,3
Merry Muscles Ergonomic Jumper Exerciser Baby Bouncer - Red,"I read a lot about this before I ordered it, and I was a little skeptical. When it finally arrived, from Canada, I was so excited ... then I opened the box. It looks like nothing! Looks cheap, and kinda ugly ... BUT, OMGoodness ... it is the best thing I have bought for the baby thus far. He loves it. He loves, loves, loves it! I love it! Everyone loves to watch him in it. It is so funny. It wears him out, strengthens his muscles, and gives him exercise he typically would not get as he is not able to walk. I believe he was in this at two months, maybe three ... read the description for the product to be sure, either way it is designed to be used earlier than other jumpers. I had him using it and then checked in with my Dr on the development of his legs and feet and he said everything looks great!My son is big, started out really small 6.14 ... but he grew fast, so I had to take out a set of stitches on the opposite side of the snaps. Read the directions on that because it is important. I figured out I needed to do that after calling the company to inquire as to why he would be jumping using only his left leg. I removed the inner set of stitches (there are two)  which made the bodice part wider, even on both sides, and he was back to two feet!Great, life saver, fantastic, wonderful, I love it!Make sure you safely secure the hook in a stud, make sure it is secure!!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Love this booster seat. We have tried several different seats and this by far has been the best. Straps perfectly to every seat we have used it on, has removable back, 2 trays, height adjutment, adjustable straps, 3pt harness, folds comatc for travel or storage and also seems to be the most comfy to sit in for our 2 boys. We will also be using this same seat for our 3rd boy when the time comes. Worth every penny!",5
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Pink/Green/White","This is awesome for toys, passies, sippies...  I was using Dropper Stoppers and really liked those but our dog ate one of them so I needed another.  I really liked this pattern & material so I tried it.  It is great - I like the velcro/adjustable straps.  I actually wish I had about 10 of these to use in the house, in the car, in the stroller... but can't justify purchasing that many :)  Highly recommend.",5
Baby Girl Pooh Disney - Baby's First Five Years Keepsake Record Book with Storage Box,The book is cute.  Not as many pages and I had expected.  Some places don't require as much writing as it gives you but might be good to fill in with pictures. I haven't tried it.  Other pages (like the shower) need a little more space. Overall the book is cute and is as described on the listing. There is a lot of storage in the box that it comes with.  I can't want to complete it and give it to my god-daughter's mom.,4
"Maclaren Volo Stroller, Black","Bought this for my 5yo 45lb son for a trip to Disney World. Sturdy, light-weight and worked great. The only shortcoming is that the canopy supports are flimsy and may not last long, otherwise 5 stars.",4
Infantino Explore and Store Elephant Gym,"The bar that arches over the top doesn't stay in place.  The straps that hold it don't hold very well.  On the plus side, my daughter thinks it's hilarious when she pops it out and it flies up and lands across her belly.  LOL!  More entertainment for her. (Don't worry guys it's made of foam ;).  Recieved it in a short amount of time.  Not the 3-4 weeks that I thought.  Only took about a week.",4
"My Brest Friend 3 in 1 Body Pillow, White","A total waste of my time and money! There is absolutely no back support so if your pregnant back is as achy as mine, invest in another product and avoid this one (I kicked it off the bed). Better yet, make your own pillow- a combination of regular pillows and your partner- it will work more effectively.",1
Yookidoo Discovery Playhouse,"My 14 month old twins recieved this for Christmas and it is amazing!  They love to play in it together (they both ift inside well) or peek through it and giggle at each other.  The balls rattle which they love and there are so many differnet ways to play- ball rollercoasters and tunnels, spinning toys, mirror- they are ative and love to chase each other inside and out. I also feel that thsi toy is safe for 12 months or even younger.  There are no sharp or small pieces and it is very sturdy.  They can use it to pull to stand and cruise it- it will slide a little but does not fall or collapse, even with two babies pulling on it. This is an a amazing toy!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"this is a great little stroller. it is heavier than you expect, but well built. the seat does recline a bit more than my son would like and doesn't seem to adjust to sit up straighter. it's bigger than you expect an umbrella stroller to be, but much better than cramming our jogging stroller in the car. Bought for road trips and times when we go to amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. where the jogging stroller is just too big.",4
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,My 3 month old daughter loves her Wubbanub's and the dog is great.  I would have given in 5 stars but the legs are not beans so there is a stiffness to the dog.  We also have the black cat and we can position that one a little better and my daughter can snuggle with it better.  Overall we love them and can't imagine not having them.,4
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I bought this bag before finding out what the sex of our baby is.  I have two boys already, I decided that even if we have another boy, I wanted this bag for me.  My husband (he didn't see it before I bought it) liked it too and said he will carry it if we have a girl.  I was shocked at that!  It's such a cute bag!  Finally having a baby doesn't mean that you have to carry a Winnie-the-Pooh, cheesy diaper bag!",5
Chicco Activity Baby Walker,"Not a bad walker but as a previous person mentioned, it tips forward very easily and the brakes don't do anything to stop the child.  The activities in front are good, and my son likes playing with it that way but I don't really trust it as a walker.",2
"Friendly Toys, Little Playzone with Electronic Sound and Lights","This item is great! It is easy to assemble, very portable, and allows the child to entertain him/herself. I would recommend this product to everyone.",5
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,"When I read that this was a ""swing gate"", I took that to believe it had a door portion that would swing open.  That is not the case.  You have to mount this to both sides of the walls then detach one side to ""swing"" the entire gate open.  It is not what I was looking for.  On top of that, we got it because we have a very wide space in our kitchen that we needed to close off for our 11 week old Pomeranian puppy, but the slots in this gate are too wide and he can actually get through the gate!  So for us, this gate is totally useless.  Unfortunately, I discovered this on the 4th day I had it and I didn't realize that Amazon's free return policy expired 2 days after it is delivered, so we are stuck with this.We ended up purchasing another tension mounted gate with a REAL swing door which will be arriving tomorrow.  I hope the slots aren't as wide so it keeps our puppy within it's confines.",2
"Prince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/Pink",Works great & looks good too. I got the white & grey one. It blends in nicely with my bathroom. It makes washing hands with my two tear old twins soo easy. They love using it.,5
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",This mattress cover is definitely too small.  I am returning it immediately.  I can't believe these people would make a product that is supposedly designed for the Graco Pack and Play...and then make it TOO SMALL!  Seems crazy to me.  It's going back tomorrow.,1
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I love the color, it's better than I used one. The only down would be it is a bit smoother than I would like. If it had some noticeable grip the case would be awesome, but I still give 5 stars.I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"My 1 month old has reflux, and while she did not like the bouncer originally, she loves it now.  We use it for her to sleep in.  My only complaint is that I wish the fabric was softer.",4
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Cambria Bassinet, Toffee",We decided to purchase this Arms Reach Co-Sleeper. We're able to roll it around our condo for easy convenience and access for our newborn daughter. Her crib and changing table /dresser are on back order for a few more weeks so this is perfect for us to use for the next few months. Matches all of our expresso furniture and dark wooden floors. One of my TOP baby item purchases. I would highly recommend this item / seller.,5
Summer Infant Mother's Touch Comfort Bath Support,Item was purchased for my granddaughter and she loves it. Lots of cushion seems very comfortable hang drys very quickly.,5
NoJo Jungle Tales 6 Piece Crib Set,"Got this crib set for our little guy who will be here soon. Nice, quality materials, vivid colors, good value. The one issue we had was tying the crib bumper. We have a standard size crib, a Bedford Baby Monterey, and besides being difficult to tie, the bumper is way too long. It is not snug at all like recommended and therefore not very safe for the baby. Now I wish I just got the separate pieces from this set, not including the bumper (although it is a very cute one).",4
Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket 2-Piece Gift Set,"How many times have you attended a baby shower and saw that great gift everyone gushed over, wishing you had thought of it first?  Well, Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket is that great gift!  The concept, of a &#34;pig in a blanket&#34;, is way cute and Baby Aspen has produced a sweet, sweet vision in this adorable little stuffed treasure.  The Pig and its blanket appear to be constructed of quality materials. Each has a soft, comforting feel that will satisfy Mom as well as Baby.  The embroidered nursery verse, found on the plush blanket's satin border, is a nice touch and adds to the Keepsake factor.  And, the plush Pig is designed to become a Special Friend for your Special Little One for many years.  Two wonderful gifts packaged as one, Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket is a unique and precious gift that will keep on giving long after the package is opened.",5
Baby Kimono Gown Sleepers,"I have been slowly adding items to my layette, and this sleeper is one of the softest and cheapest items in the collection so far. It is simple yet well-made, and though it's a classic piece, it's hard to find things this basic. It ranks in quality and feel with Petit Bateau, Coccoli and other high-end European baby wear. I highly recommend this item!",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","This gate is perfect for what I was looking for- a sturdy pressure gate with larger width and heighth to keep our 60-lb dog in our front yard. One thing to note, when opening the gate, you need to pull up on the door enough to release the top & bottom ""latches"".  Once you explain it to others, we've found that its not an issue. It should definitely work to keep smaller children in, as releasing the door takes more coordination than younger ages might have. Make sure everyone steps over the 1"" rise when walking through the door-- or you might be readjusting the gate to get it back into place.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I like the sturdiness and the look of this metal gate.  My 7 and 9 year old children have no problems using it-- and our dog is happy to be able to join us in the front yard.",5
"timi &amp; leslie Rachel 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","This bag is fantastic. Wonderful. It is very stylish and extremely functional.  It is super spacious and has a place for everything.  I was carrying a Coach tote bag because I have several and didn't think a disper bag was necessary.  i thought I could use the Coach tote since it is large and roomy but things were everywhere.  The timi and leslie bag helps me keep it all organized imstead of everything jumbled up all over the bottome of the bag.  The win color is beautiful.  I so wanted to avoid a baby looking diaper bag and I hit the jackpot with this bag because it is so fabulously stylish.  I am not sacrificing style while carrying this bag as a new mom.  My favorite feature is the small purse inside that allows me to organize my things like makeup, money, phone, etc. separately.  I love this bag!",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","This thing DOES NOT LEAK.  It can hold up to 5 scoops of Enfamil in each of the 3 chambers (= 10 oz in the bottle  x three), and is easy to dispense, even with one hand, on a turbulent airplane. For refills, the whole top comes off super easy as well. (For those who have trouble removing the top, try lining the spout up with a chamber line&#8230; i.e.. yank the top up from where it's sturdiest.)",5
"My Brest Friend Slipcover, Blue Gold Marina","My son had an EXPLOSIVE poop all over the original slipcover to this nursing pillow and I had no intentions of trying to clean it... I ordered this one and it fits great (and is much prettier than the other one I had!). Even after washing/drying, it fits nicely and is easy to put back on. I recommend this if you want to switch things up :) Do wash it before you put it on though, as it comes out of the package rather stiff.",5
Vilac Developmental Memory Game,"Memory game.Cute.Well made.We wrote in French on it to aid in memorization.Overall, a good deal, seems like it will last.",4
Beco Baby Gemini Carrier In Paige,"I bought this item along with the Ergo Baby justBecause I was having such a hard time deciding between the two. I got the Ergo and thought it was comfortable and wellMade and easy to use. HOWEVER, I am a petite person and even when I had the straps adjusted all the way down I still had a very hard time buckling the back buckle by myself so I ended up returning it.The Beco on the other hand is a much more versatile carrier because it offers several more carries and it seems the straps have a lot more wiggle room in terms Of adjustments. I also liked how for a facing in front carry you have the option to make the leg base narrower. I can easily reach my hands over my head and buckle the back buckle by myself. Also every review I read complained that you need 2 hands to unbuckle which I haven't found to be the case at all. I buckle it around my waist and keep the sides buckled at all times then pick up and position my baby put the straps over my shoulders one by one while supporting her with one arm them buckle behind my head. To take it off I follow the same steps in reverse and hold my index finger down on the safety feature of the waist buckle and unclasp the buckle with my thumb and middle finger. My daughter is 3 months and 11 lbs and I've used it about a month now and have never once risked dropping her or had problems getting this on or off.I feel safe and secure walking and doing household chores while using this. And my baby seems to love it too. It has definitely made life easier :)",5
"OXO Tot Training Cup, Aqua, 7 Ounce","First of all, the review by Kenneth M. Saltzman (one of the top reviews) is right on. If your little one is getting too much liquid, try using two of the covers (called something else I can't quite remember) to block more fluid.I first tried these out when my son turned one, but he was just not ready yet. He still was treating it like it was a sippie cup and even if I only put in 2mL, it would still get all over him because it was too much too fast. I didn't consider using two of the covers at once, so I just purchased the OXO straw cups of the same size, and they worked perfectly.When little guy turned 15 months, I tried with these again, and he got the hang of it within a few meals. When he was about 18 months, he started to get annoyed by how the covers blocked the liquid, so I just took the covers off, and after a little bit of spills, he can now use a cup like a big boy.I wouldn't recommend these for any baby under the age of one, but I would also caution not to expect your little geniuses to get the hang of drinking from these right away. Learning to drink like an adult is difficult stuff for babies. Just put in small amounts of liquid until they get it down, and then when they can really drink like adults, just remove the covers--now you have an &#34;adult&#34; cup for your little one without having to go out and buy something else right away.",5
Recaro Vivo Lite Child Booster Car Seat - Carbon,"The booster seat is great except for one issue.  The booster seat's plastic ""shoulder-belt holder"" makes it difficult for the shoulder belt to retract and hold firm the seatbelt across my childs' chest.  I notice my boys sitting in their boosters and the strap across their chest is very loose.  I always tell my boys to pull the shoulder belt part tight.  However, during a trip, when they lean forward/sideways to pick something up from the side seat, the belt doesn't retract back and I have to ask them to snug it up again.I have tried everything to get the belt to be able to slide through the plastic easily enough for the belt to retract back into its system.  But, nothing has made this issue better.  My Costco booster seats did not do this.",4
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","My only complaint is that this is not as purple as it looks in the picture... Its more of a pestle pink color. I ordered it for my SON because it seemed purple to go with a tee shirt from my sister but... its definitely more pink. It gets a 4 out of 5 because I will still use it, love these diaper covers over all, Just not the color I expected.",4
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","The seat fits great in our 2010 Toyota Tundra. I had a Graco MySize 70 that was a pain to get my son in. The RXT is great for us because of the low sides, it's easy to slide him in and out of in the middle seat with out 'offering him to the gods'. The only complaint is the shoulder belt install. My truck doesn't have latch hooks for the middle seat, but it is the safest position and it doesn't cause the seats to move forward. I was sweating after I finally got it in. It's not passing the belt through the base, it's the belt lock that's hard to get right. I was doing it by myself. If I had help it might have been easier to get a secure fit. I did find that sitting on the seat while securing the belt worked best.",4
"Sunshine Kids Adjustable Stroller Umbrella Shade, Black",Only wish there was more of a Metal clip then plastic provides adequate shade for my 2 year old and 3 month old while traveling in their stroller.,4
Boppy Rock in Comfort Travel Swing - Pink,"This is the only swing we need for our Little Man (we bought it in blue).  The thing about baby swings is that babies LOVE them, but they only use them a few months, and the full-sized ones take up a huge amount of space.  This is the perfect compromise on all fronts.  My son was born large (nearly 10 lbs at birth), and he still fits in this swing just fine at 4 months and 16 lbs.  We use this product every day and wouldn't trade it.PRO: compact.  Traveled with us to vist Grandparents, fit in car backseat foot well with no problem.  Sits in our living room on the floor by the coffee table without taking up enormous amounts of space like other swings.  Can move it around the house easily to keep baby near me.  Can take it up to the office if we need to have baby there with us.  Very comfy - hammock-like swing keeps baby soothed and not too upright for comfort.  Nice neutral color scheme doesn't look juvenile in my living room.  *FITS INSIDE THE BOPPY HAPPY PLACE PLAYYARD* - My son has very bad allergies/colds, and a few nights we locked the swing (to make it stationary) and just put it inside the playyard so he could sleep more upright - worked like a charm!!CON:  battery life could last longer.  The toy bar is removable, which I like, and it swivels back and forward, but not far enough back or forward.  Sometimes we still bump the baby's head getting him out, though the bar is not hard enough to hurt, which is also good.  The music is just ok... not particularly soothing.  But it does play at 2 levels, which is good.I would highly recommend this product!!  We love it.UPDATE 6/21/10 - My son used this product until he was about 6-7 months old, at which point he was sitting up solidly, preferred floor or bouncer time, and only wanted his swing for naps.  So, if you get this and a decent bouncer, I question whether you really need anything else for activity time for at least the first 8-9 months.",5
"Baby Aspen My Little Night Owl Snuggle Sack and Cap, 0-6 Months","I bought this costume for my 3-mo. old granddaughter who still has her days and nights mixed up!!!  Couldn't be more appropriate!!!  I'm sure she will look precious in it (even though she's really too young for Halloween, I couldn't resist!)",5
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Learn-to-Flush","My soon to be three year old loved his new potty.  I was having trouble completing the potty training process on the home toilet with a removable ring, he would only pee. When I bought the ring I had gotten rid of his plain potty. Well, needed to get him potty trained if I wanted to get him into a local preschool. That's when we shopped for his potty together online and choose this one. He LOVES IT!! He was in underwear exclusively only 10 days later. I was completely shocked, I think it was a combination of him being ready, and allowing him to be a part in the  purchasing of his potty ;). So glad to be done with diapers!! This potty is interactive with the user, has a great flush noise, and praise songs for when they use the item.",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","We bought two of these, one for each bathroom.  Our two year old loves brushing his teeth and washing his hands independently!",5
Thudguard Baby Protective Safety Helmet Lilac,This safety helmet keeps your kids from bumping to hard objects when he or she falls but our 8 months old can't wear this for more than 10 minutes because gets too hot and sweat from wearing the helmet.Wish it has different material to keep the head cool to be able to wear longer.,3
"Baby Einstein Mobile, Sweet Sea Dreams","I got this product for my son when he was three months old. It has never really held his attention for very long. It is nice to have the ocean sounds to help lull him to sleep, however they only last about twenty five minuets.",3
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Marina the Mermaid",I bought this for my daughter when she was 4months old and this has become one of her favorite friends to play with and take on the road. She loves biting on the green seahorse & Marina's fin. The colors of the mermaid really grab her attention too! A really great purchase!,5
juDanzy solid white baby &amp; toddler boys and girls leg warmers,"Although not the brightest white, my daughter can definitely wear for years to come.

Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"For the price point that this are at, I would say this video monitor is a great product. The color display for the daytime picture is crisp and clear. Motion isn't perfectly smooth, but more than good enough and a lot cheaper than the ones with high end video. The nighttime b&w display is a little grainier than I would have like and 10 ft is about the max range of the IR LEDs. At night though it is still good enough for seeing if our boy is moving around or sleeping. Seeing a chest rise from breathing like some may want may be hard to tell, especially without going cross eyed trying to look at the monitor. Range is great. Works anywhere in our house and works out to our mailbox at about 300 ft from the house as long as I am not standing between the transmitter and receiver. I would definitely recommend.",4

Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"This is our fave cup thus far. My little one is 10 months old so we're just starting on sippy/straw cups. This is the first and only cup so far that he has drunk out of.  I love the weighted straw and the handles. I also really like that the straw is flexible so that my little one can bend the straw to fit in his mouth. We have only offered water so far but it's been easy to clean. The cup has been thrown a few times onto hardwood floor and has held up well.  Once be starts using the cup more often, I plan on buying more of these.",4
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","I use these with gDiapers gCloth refills. They usually protect the top surface of the gCloth refill, but not always the sides. But much better than having a completely poopy cloth diaper! I love that they're flushable so I don't have any stinky waste in the trash can, and I haven't had any trouble with the toilet. They're good for protecting the cloth diapers from diaper rash cream too. One unsoiled piece went into the laundry by mistake once, and came out good as new again, and I was able to reuse it - makes me wonder just how long they take to biodegrade, but you could save some money reusing them.",5
"OXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue","This is great and helps tremendously when bending over the tub to bath the baby.  It pads my knees well so that I can focus on what I am doing and folds away small for between bath times.  It also has great grip so that it doesn't slid nor do I slid on top of it.  I would definitely recommend this product and thought it was a great value.  I use this frequently.  I only wish that it came in other colors so that it better coordinated with our color theme, but that is not a priority I guess.",5
"Munchkin Snappy Bottle Tote, Colors May Vary","My Dr. Brown bottles would not fit in the bag so I am returning it.  Also, be sure you note the word ""Assorted"" in the product title.  I thought I was ordering the one pictured with the owls and got a pink one instead.",3

Bizzy Babee Nursing Cover (Coral),I really wanted to like this but my 3 month old hated it! She cried and wiggled until I pulled her out from underneath this cover. I would go for the hooter hider.,1
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","We went thru several versions of bath thermometers before coming across this one...so far it's doing great. Seems sturdy enough to endure the manhandling of our two year old without dying on us, and readings are accurate. I like the blue, green and red lights that radiate even thru bubbles!",5
"OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green",I got a set of these to try at our local baby store and was thrilled at how our little one took to them. They are very nicely shaped for little hands and mouths and has improved our oldest's ability to eat without adult help.  I also loved how they are turqouise/aqua so they work well for both boys AND girls which is really hard to find out there!  We will have to buy some more when our littlest starts eating on their own because our oldest loves them so much!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!",5
"Bumkins Nixi Travel Bag with Clear Front, Mica, 3 Count","bought for camping & have worked so far- used medium for frozen food item so there was still condensation that got things a bit damp but expected that. use the large one for a toiletry bag. some things will cling to the clear side, but not an issue. will buy more if needed.",4
BABYBJORN Babysitter Balance Air - Black Mesh,"Our five month old still sits in this thing all the time.  It provides the perfect amount of support for him and he stays happy in it for awhile.  We love that it is easy to pick up and move from room to room as we need to, and that it folds in to nothing for travel.  Awesome product.",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep",I read several reviews and decided that even if the Cloud B Lamb wasn't used to soothe and calm the new baby it surely would be a wonderful companion to stroller or any other baby item.  When the item arrived it was so wonderfully soft and sweet that it inspired me to look for similar Lamb items.,5

Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"I saw in the baby stores they don't really recommend the soy products, why I don t know. Bit this is pretty good. Hasn't lumped, sagged, shrunk or anything. Well worth the more than half price",5
"Sassy 2 Count Grow Up Cup, Purple/Orange, 9 Ounce","FYI, I've been using the same set of 6 that I purchased 18 months ago when I wrote my original review.  Ours do not leak, but you need to separate the ribbed ring from the hard plastic top to wash them, or they can stretch and--yes, possibly leak (not to mention harboring germs).  Separate them to wash and you won't have issues.So here is my general update:My son has been using these cups--the same set--for 18 months now, with no leaking issues.  He is now 4 years old, and I still use these for car trips, water in bed, and out-and-about; essentially, anywhere that you are not sitting at a table where spilling would be a major issue. Heck, I think it's a great idea even for adults (haven't brought myself to be seen using it yet though LOL)My son got too big for the sippies with the spouts, and I got sick of disassembling/reassembling straw cups, plus worrying about the straw part getting clean (no way can those get truly clean, I would guess), so I found these--read below for further tips.P.S.they now come in an insulated version, and I could not be more excited, as the weather is starting to warm up.  They will be great for keeping things cooler in the warmer weather!Original review from 18 months ago:Here's my story, but to get to the point of how to get your child used to the cup, HOLD THE CUP UPSIDE DOWN FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE GIVING TO YOUR CHILD THE FIRST FEW TIMES, TO GET THE LIQUID STARTED, TO HELP THEM ""GET"" HOW IT WORKS.  It only took my son one try once I did this.I got a set of two of these cups before my son was used to sippies; he tried them and could not get them to work, so I returned them.Now my son is 30 months old and has been using an open cup for about 8 months, but we still use sippys whenever spilling may be an issue.  I have the Take and Toss sippies, the lids are past nasty at this point, and I found we can no longer get replacement lids, so I had to find something else (we do use straw cups for water, but I don't want to put milk in those).So...I thought I'd try these again.The first time he tried it, he couldn't get anything out and I had to convince him to try it again.  I turned the cup upside down for a few seconds to let the liquid ""get into"" the rubber part a bit (to prime it, so to speak), and the next drink he took, he was hooked (and I haven't had to ""prime"" it since that first time)! He even tells us ""I like this cup"".  I figure even though he's almost 3, it will be worth it to have several on hand as these will be great cups for the car, etc. for quite some time.  An added bonus is these are MUCH easier to clean than sippies-so glad to be done with that, too!!!",5
Chicco Great Shakes Monkey Toy,"My son absolutely loved this guy, we actually had to buy another one because our dog ate the rattle off the first, and it just wasn't the same after that. :( lol.  Once he was older and realized he could pull the chain himself, it was like a whole new toy to him. Mr monkey is a great buy for a newborn, durable, easy to clean. LOVE LOVE!!",5

Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"Love that this is unisex, and all the vibrant coloring...my daughter has enjoyed this toy from 4 months until now, she just turned a year old! There are lots of interactive toys, including a squeaker and a mirror on the mat, as well as some crinkle material and different textures.  It is easy to wash and also easy to fold up to put away! Would definitely recommend it.",5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",I am very happy with this pacifier holder. The clip that holds the pacifier to the child is very secure and does not slip off of what it is clipped to. I have had issues with pacifier holders that only have a close-pin type clip that holds it to the child where it slips off. I would recommend this holder to anyone that does not want to have to keep cleaning pacifiers throughout the day because they keep falling on the floor.,5
"Badger Basket Modern Changing Table with 3 Baskets and Hamper, Espresso","My wife and I picked this out after shopping around numerous Big Box stores for the right changing table.  We took a chance with this one and it is better than most in the stores.  Many changing tables were very wobbly and seemed extremely cheaply made.  We read the other reviews and decided on this table.  We are extremely satisfied after one month of use.  If you like this color, you will be satisfied with this changing table.  The larger bin underneath is great for dirty clothes and the three drawers are perfect for storing diapers and hygiene items.  I cannot give 5 stars unless an item is perfect.  There are minor nuances and the build quality could be slightly better.",4

Gerber Brand 3 Pack Boy's Terry Dribbler Bib,"Can't give it 5 stars only because my baby isn't born yet and I don't know how the bibs will hold up.  But I've washed them, and they kept their shape nicely.  And they're super cute!",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We ordered one at the end of the year. It suddenly stopped working after almost exactly a month. Fortunately, it was just within the window to get a replacement. Four months later, the new one died. No picture and then won't pair. Don't waste your money, buy a more expensive one that's going to last more than a few months!",1
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This was exactly what we needed after we moved into a house with narrow wooden stairs. It was a little tricky to put in but that was probably because I was trying to do it with my kids around. A couple of reviewers said the adhesive pads it comes with to stick to the wall were not needed however I couldn't get mine to stay straight for tightening without them. However, that could just be me. It's very sturdy, my daughter pulls up on it and it hasn't budged and my older kids figured out how to open and close it with no problem. I love that it swings shut automatically in case the kids forget to close it. I'm completely happy with this gate and would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock Re-usable Sippy Cups, 10 Ounce, 8-Count",Love these cups for both my grandchildren.  They can't get the lid off and even when dropped they don't leak.,4
"Prince Lionheart Back to Sleep Sack, Medium, Blue","After the first night, we thought this sleep sack was ok. It fit fine, and the mesh opening at the bottom did seem to keep the boy's feet from getting too stinky. But there were issues: The satin lining makes it kinda hard to hold the baby--he slid around inside it too much. And the zipper is terrible! It feels chintzy from the first time you use it--the pull tab gets stuck. And then on the second morning, we brought our son into bed with us. After a little while we noticed little blue flecks on our sheets. The paint was peeling off the zipper's pull tab! I'm not a maniac about baby safety, and I understand that my boy will be exposed to things and put all kinds of dirt into his mouth, but I certainly don't want it to be detritus that comes off his supposedly baby-safe clothing.If it weren't for the zipper, I'd give this two or three stars. But because of that, it gets one. How hard would it have been for the manufacturer to use a better zipper?",1
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","After trying just about every sippy cup on the market, (Nuby, Nuk, Munchkin, Beaba, etc.), I gave my 10-month-old boys the straw version of the Safe Sippy. They LOVE it. It is just like they're drinking out of a normal straw, which they love doing but is almost always a disaster. It is easy to clean, durable, and doesn't leak (the Munchkin ones are impossible to reassemble after cleaning). I'm amazed there are any negative reviews of these because they are perfect if you're kid likes straws.",5
Delta Fun Time 36 X 36&quot; Play Yard,"I bought this for my twin nephews who are now 14 months while initially they didn't take, (as they sleep in their parents bed with their down comforter and what not) so this ended up being for the grandparents house, it works great now, they're passed out in it as I type this, however I am certain in a few months time I don't know that they'll still be able to sleep in it, I kind of wish I had gotten it sooner. Oh well c'est la vie",5

Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.",5
Accu-Light One-Second Ear Themometer,"I bought this after trying a ton of others and I was very, very pleased with it till I tried to buy the plastic probe covers. You can't find them anywhere. I also called Safety 1st and they couldn't help me either cause the product was to new and they weren't sure if it was going to stay on the shelf (whatever that means)I do like it and would like to keep it. The light is so nice at night and it reads in less then a second.SO I gave it a rating of a 4 only because of the trouble with the probe covers. I hope they resolve the problem soon...",4

"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I'm 7 months pregnant and reaching that stage where it's hard to find that comfortable position. While I'm not as thrilled about this pillow as I thought I was going to be, it is easier to get comfortable and sleep with it. It has it's pros and cons. First, I found this pillow is super flexible. I can fold the side up and slide out of bed in the middle of the night for my bathroom runs. I was thinking I would have to climb over it but that's not the case, so hubby can still sleep.  I think I'll still use this pillow after the baby is born because it's so flexible you can bend it however you like. Keep in mind it won't just stay in that bend position of course, it isn't a pipe cleaner, but it's flexibility makes it versatile.However, while the flexibility is great, I was hoping for more firmer support in the belly area and the area just above where your bump would lay. If you look at the photos of this product, from the area in the middle for bump support to the area of the &#34;u&#34; bend is leaves much to be desired. It seems there is less filling there, and mine naturally folds there. That's how I flip it up to get out of bed.  It's also bad because that's where I want to ideally lay my head since the &#34;u&#34; bend is so uncomfortable for the neck and shoulders. It's the seam there I think, there is another review that explains it.I used to be more of a stomach side sleeper, but as my pregnancy progressed I found myself more and more wanting to sleep on my back. The main reason I got a pillow like this rather than a candy cane shaped one is cause I thought it would help keep me on my side and still support my back and bump.  Not really the case for me, like I said, it's super flexible.  I like this pillow rather than continuously propping myself up all night with 3 or 4 pillows, but it wasn't my dream pillow.  I say take your chances and return it if it's not the one for you.",3
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black","the setup on this crib is soooo easy. good quality product, small footprint and very portable. not sure how long my baby will fit in this, though. she's 7mo right now, so it will be interesting to see how it serves us once she can stand/climb etc! overall a great purchase, and it will definitely be used for future babies or when we have visitors with little ones!",5

Fuzzi Bunz Cloth Pocket Diaper AQUA - Petite Toddler,We purchased these diapers when our little one was in between sizes. She had outgrown the medium cloth diapers but was not yet ready for the large cloth diapers. The petites were a great option and allowed us to continue cloth diapering for an extended amount of time.,5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"As others have noted, the hole for the light switch was slightly too small which didn't allow the switch to go completely to the &#34;on&#34; position. We haven't filed it down yet, but it should be an easy fix.  Also, it doesn't glow in the dark, at least not in our room, I suspect it has to really soak up light for several hours in order for that to happen. For the price, give it a try, but I don't know I would purchase again.",3

Short Pique-Fleece Bassinet Liner/Skirt and Hood - Size: 16x32,"This is a beautiful bassinet cover at a fraction of the cost of most of them.  Also it has more style than many of them that just have acres of froo-frooey lace.  The only problem we had was determining the correct size to buy.  You almost have to do it by trial-and-error and since it's not an Amazon product we had to pay $11 shopping to rerurn the first one (almost 1/4 of the total price).  That said, we think it is sophisticated and charming and still economical.",4
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I bought this pillow based on the high reviews.  It's not a bad pillow, but it definitely isn't as great as I was expecting!  The first couple weeks with it, it was amazing!  But then, all the fluff started to flatten and no matter how hard I try to fluff it back up, nothing seems to work.  Also, the top where you would put your head, the stuffing seems to be separating, so there's little to no support for your neck and head.  I started waking up with horrible headaches from bad support, so I have started using a thin pillow lain on top of the pregnancy pillow for extra support.  And I have tried to push the stuffing back together in that area, it doesn't work.  Overall, it's not a bad pillow, but not necessarily for the price.  It works good enough that I will continue to use it through the rest of my pregnancy.",3
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,"I was glad to find these in assorted sizes and they've been useful on a couple different rings I have. However, on my everyday ring that I haven't gotten around to resizing, wearing a snuggie on it everyday causes the plastic to stretch a little and the opening widens - and then the snuggies to pop off and get lost. It's about 6 mos later and I've run out of snuggies! Still a good option for occasional wear, though, if you don't want to pay for resizing. At least it doesn't scratch the metal like the other kinds of guards do.",3
Phil and Teds Explorer Stroller with Doubles Kit- Apple/Black,I found this stroller to be very heavy and hard to fold. I had to ask my husband to unfold because it would not open for me because it was locked shut. I Do not like for the cost of this stroller that it does not come with a snack tray or a cup holder. I am Trying to return this item. It looks great but is not my go to stroller!,3
Chewy Stixx Oral Tubes Tough Bar---For children with aggressive biting habits.,"I got this for my 4 yr old son with autism. He tends to chew on everything... all day long: his sleeves, shirt collars, finger/nails to the blood, etc. I gave him one of my 2 year old's chew toys from when he was a baby, and my son went to town on it.We got this one and it works pretty well. It's very tough, yet cushy enough for chewing. It's just a little too thick for his little mouth. He may want to use it more as he gets older. We ended up getting the &#34;chewy tubes super chew knobby&#34; and it works better for him. Plus, we are able to tie a shoe string through the handle and he can wear it all day. So far, it's been 2 months and its still in good shape.",4
Naomi Home Deluxe Sleigh Glider and Ottoman Set Black/Mocha,"I really liked the look of this glider and the chair itself is comfortable. The complaints I have are:1. It took longer than expected to arrive. I kept getting emails further delaying when I could expect to receive the item. Granted, they did give me the option of cancelling my order, but I had spent so much time investigating the possible options before finally deciding on this one and I didn't want to start over.2. In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered a glider that came with a darker fabric. It's not terrible, but this one certainly does show dirt and you can't really clean it.3. My biggest complaint is the ottoman. It's several inches lower than the chair, which you can see in the picture, but which I didn't realize would be an issue. It was the first thing my friend commented on when she sat in it and, when I sat in hers (which has an ottoman that is about even with the chair), I realized how much more comfortable hers was. If I put a pillow on top of the ottoman, it's more comfortable.",3
"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count",These refills are cheaper and there is not smell! We had a smell with the actual Diaper Genie brand but Nursery Fresh is definitely fresher. We'll buy these from now on.,5
DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - Natural,"I had bought one of the convertible cribs for my son.  Finally, he was ready to convert to a full size bed.  The person who put my bed together ( it wasn't me.... ain't nobody got time for that!), put it together with relative ease.  The only thing that happened was that he put them on &#34;backwards,&#34; so when it was time to put the bed in, it did not fit.  Easily resolved!",5
Amberizon Baltic Teething Bracelet Honey Amber,"This FLEW off of my daughters wrist and ankles constantly.  It wound up getting lost at some point and I've since purchased a necklace instead.  If your child isn't wearing socks 24/7, this may be difficult to keep on them.",2
Manito Baby Shampoo Shower Hat / Cap / Visor / Shield (Kiwi / Green),"I am an adult with a 22 1/2&#34; head circumference (just for reference) and I bought this item because I get terrible ear infections and can not get water in my ears for the time my ears are infected/healing, and therefore cannot wash my hair when I am having problems with my ears. This item has been a god-send for me! It works great; it helps direct the flow of water over the visor and my ears completely! I can totally recommend this product and would be very willing to use it with children for eye protection. In fact, small children might feel better about using it if they saw an adult trying it out too.",5
The First Years Breastflow Starter Set,"We used this bottle system for our daughter from birth and loved it!  She had no problems going from breast to bottle and back, even after long periods on the breast.  We did have some small leakage problems if it wasn't screwed on really tight, but having an easy time getting her to drink from a bottle made it all worth the while.  We will be using these again for our next baby!Update 4/14/2012:Well, our next baby did not use these bottles.  We tried, but she just wouldn't use them at all.  Of course, she wouldn't take any bottle, so I don't know how much was a reflection on this brand and how much was just her picky nature.",4
Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,"I received this product to encourage my baby to enjoy tummy time and not only did it have one hole in it, but it had to leaks in it!  There are only two water mats made out there currently and I was severly disappointed that this is what we received!",1
Bellotte Designer Shopper Tote Diaper Bag in Ruby,"Thought I got a good deal for a designer diaper bag, my daughter is just 4 months and we a planning to replace it already.

Bought a pricey screen protector at best buy and then bought this just to find that a day or two later my screen protector was full or red spots. Good product for what its worth.,1
"Dappi Diaper Doublers, White","I bought these doublers for my 10-month old baby girl who had been soaking through all her cloth diapers. With these doublers, she can now go up to 2 or 2 1/2 hours in her diaper, instead of just 1 hour. These aren't absorbent enough for overnight, but work great during the day. And you can't beat the price!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","I didn't care for the instructions when I got the gate.  They seamed very complicated because there were only small pictures that explained how to put it together.  So... I just looked at how that gate should look on the packaging picture and was able to easily put it together. I also had to buy the extension piece and that was easy to install, too.  All I needed was a flat screwdriver.  I really like this gate because I was able to install it on the bottom of the stairs in our finished basement and I didn't need to make any holes in the wall.  Plus, it's very easy to open with one hand and looks nice. It's definitely tall enough to block my 16 month old daughter from going on the stairs yet it's short enough for me to even walk over it without having to open it.",5
Adventures in Bali Bib in Elephant Appliqu&eacute;,"I love Under The Nile products! I have purchased a very large number of their products since finding out almost nine months ago that we're expecting. The more I buy from them, the more I want to buy! This bib is so super cute and I'd had my eye on it for months! When I found it on sale, I just had to buy it and I am so glad that I did. It's so, so, so cute. Very soft, of course, because it's organic cotton. And, as with all of the Under The Nile products I've purchased, it appears to be very well made. I love the stretchy pull-over style neck on it. Highly recommended!",5
Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat in Regal,"I bought this car seat for my grandson.  I believe my daughter and son-in-law are very happy with the seat.  It is not one of those which is easy to move from vehicle to vehicle so they bought a less expensive one for me to use when I have the baby.  But all in all, it is a VERY safe and well made seat.  I would definately buy Britax Boulevard again.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"AND IT IS!  Sofie is soft, gnawable, and her belly sqeaks.  My 4.5 month old son likes to gnaw her hooves, try to tear her legs apart, and gun her ears.  Sofie and a wubbanub (and Peppa Pig TV) make our lives so much easier.",5
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),My 4 month old was developing a flat spot on his noggin from sleeping on his back. I tried moving him but he favored sleeping on his right side. I got this pillow a couple weeks ago and I think it is helping. The spot hasn't gotten worse at least. I am still going to a specialist about the flat spot but this pillow is at least giving me peace of mind the problem isn't getting worse.Its a nice soft pillow too.,5
Funkoos Airplanes Organic Baby Sleep Gown:6 - 9 mon,"The Funkoos sleep gown cotton material is very soft and stays soft after washing.  The embroidery is a nice touch.

This easily fits an average size baby up to 12 months, maybe longer.",5

"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Rocket, Small",We use halo for our 7 month old so for our friend's baby shower I knew we had to get one.  Mom really only wanted organic cotton but because of how pretty it is think she will be fine with 100 percent. I love it.,5
Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock,"I have wasted more money on baby safety products than I even care to talk about.  This is the ONLY one I have found yet that truly works.

"Graco Classic Ride 50 Convertible Car Seat, Boyton","Our 18-month daughter needed a rear-facing carseat with more room than the Snugride 35 we had before.  This fits the bill perfectly.  She loved it the moment it came out of the box and seems to really enjoy car trips in it.It was reasonably easy to install with the LATCH system, although I had to prop up one end with some towels to get it to sit level enough.  The buckles and straps are very easy to handle and adjust, and the whole thing comes apart easily in case cleaning is necessary (I know this by personal experience in a story best left untold.)  The straps are plenty roomy to get a child in and out easily and quickly, even in a coat, and the straps are also really easy to loosen and tighten.We haven't been in an accident, so I can't say how well it would protect a child in that case. But from all appearances, it looks like it will do as well as anything else and better than most others.",5

Ameda White Valve - 2 Each,The valves don't come in the package as shown in the picture. These white valves are already defective when they arrived.It's a waste of money. I ordered 3 pairs!!

My oldest son is now able to reach the back of the driver seat and would often smear whatever he had on his shoes.  This definitely will prevent any permanent damage to the fabric of the seats.  I would recommend it 100%.  Besides all, it was surprisingly easy to install the Kick Mats.",5
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"Not sure why you would throw these away... Maybe if you're super rich and don't believe in washing, but these are great. And we throw them in the dishwasher every time. My son who is not even 18 months can use these and actually loves them, even if he can't scoop his food he likes to have it in one hand and eat with the other. Funny, cute stuff. I also throw these in my diaper bag when I know we'll be eating out so that he can have it at the restaurant as well. I would order these again if I ever lost all the spoons, but I don't see a shortage happening anytime soon.",5
Riley's Roses Window Treatment Panels by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 2,"Whether or not you are buying these window treatment panels to accompany the Riley's Roses toddler bedding set, these panels will add a soft, feminine touch to any girl's bedroom that she will completely adore. Delicate pink roses perfectly complimenting a trim of fresh-foliage green seem to instantly transform your daughter's room into an enchanting cottage garden.  I recently purchased these panels for my 2 1/2 year old, and she absolutely loves them.  I would definitely recommend these panels for any girl's room.",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I have been eyeing this stroller for several months and finally bit the bullet and bought it this month.  My son, who is 17 months old, seems to really love this stroller (and he doesn't like most strollers)!  I purchased the red stripe color, and it is very sporty and cool looking.  The stroller handles and turns really smoothly.  I haven't had to deal with spills yet, but the fabric of the seat appears to be really easy to clean.  There is a decent size storage basket underneath the seat for jackets and a small diaper bag.  I don't know that I really care for the design of the cup holder (it's like a fanny pack design), but I do love that there is a zippered pocket for keys, phone, etc.  I bought a Brico snack pod to attach to the side of the stroller since there is no snack tray.  I will also add that I am 5'10, and the handle height is very comfortable for me.  The only thing I am considering modifying is the handles (perhaps adding bike tape to make them a little more comfortable).  Otherwise, I can't really complain about this great little stroller!",5
"Bamboobies Brahhh: Maternity, Sleep and Nursing&nbsp;Bra with Flower Accent (Large, Blackberry)",I purchased this item for my daughter who is pregnant.  She requested it and loves it.  I am very pleased!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After all the 5 star reviews of the Vulli, I ordered this. I am an enthusiastic, older first time mom (after 4 years of infertility) meaning- I spare no expense on my daughter, but this was truly a waste of money. There are hundreds of other teethers that are far better construction, function, delight, etc. What a disappointment. The one salvation was that its cute- but for 20 bucks?!! A lot of overpriced nostalgia.",1

Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this, and tried it out straight out of the box, and it worked perfectly. Then I sterilized all of the parts and tried again, and there was no suction. I took it apart and put it back together, but still nothing. After sterilizing all the parts, the pump simply would NOT work.",1
Philips AVENT Straw Cups 9oz 12m+ - Pink,"I ordered the 9 oz cups and got the 7 oz cups. I noticed it after i got it out of the box and so i couldn't return it. And I don't think the measurements on the cup are accurate( for a 4 oz measurement in my Pyrex measuring cup, the straw cup shows a 5 oz).I would say the pros of this cup areits easy to clean(compared to tommy tippee straw cups)it's leak proofits easy for my baby to drink by herself.The cons areit's kind of tricky to get the lid to open because just the part that covers the straw keeps rotating when you try to open it( even while you are pressing it on both sides as per the markings).The inner lid doesn't budge. I need to get the straw cover out to open the lid.Overall, it's an okay cup. I would have felt better if I had gotten the 9 oz cups that I had actually ordered.",3
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,"wasnt sure about these but thought I could try. I only wanted a drink EVERY NOW and then with my husband. so I bought these and still have most loll. but they work, only bad thing is if you use it and let it stand for the 2 minutes with ANY alcohol around it at all it will pick it up in the air, so it can give you a false result. but GRET product",5
Twooth Timer Twooth Timer,"I had high hopes that this timer would be a fun way to encourage my kids to brush longer!

Don't waste your time or money :(",1

"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I ordered a med and a large, not sure what size I would need. I ended up keeping both because they are great wet bags- contain the smell and moisture no problem. The medium is the perfect size to send with her in her diaper bag for a full day of diapers. The large has a great snap handle that I have attached to her changing table that can easily hold a few days if you want. All in all, great wet bag!",5
"Delta Canton Full Size Wood Bed Rails, Black","Bought this to go with our crib which will turn it into a full-size bed.  They don't make the rails that match exactly to our crib and these were the closest.  Besides the fact that there will be a comforter covering the rails, they actually match really well and you can't notice they aren't an exact match.  We have the crib in chocolate and the rails we bought are espresso cherry.",4
Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail,"We just put our 2.5 yr old in a twin bed. There are not alot of selection available in stores and I am familar with Safety 1st. This took maybe 10 minutes to assemble, no difficulties at all. When we put it on the bed, I will admit that it did take us awhile to figure out that you can extend the net to get the best fit on the mattress. Now figuring that out, it works great. The first night I slept with my daughter, leaned on the rail and everything and it stayed in tact!",5
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","This is a great idea and I can see how it would be convient to protect your seats but it doesnt work well if your seats in your car do not have a gap to slide the back of this into between the top and bottom part of the cars seat.  Otherwise good, my car seat base doesnt seem as solid with this under it.",4
"OXO Tot Roll Up Bib, Aqua","This bib does the trick for spills and the velcro around the neck is very secure around my 7 month old's neck.  Like other reviewers I agree this bib needs to be wider for the shoulders, but one is bound to get baby food somewhere, which is the ONLY negative about this bib. To catch those frontal spills, this bib can't be beat!!  This bib is way better than the baby bjoran, which I have for my 5 1/2 year old who still spills crumbs and rice.  The wipe off to this Oxo bib is easy and folding up for taking with is a breeze, worth the money spent, I bought a green one too and the colors are accurate to the photo listed.  Happy buying and enjoy! :-D",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","You can not fault this bed, it opens and folds very quickly and easily, its a great size and very comfy. Our 3 year old loves sleeping on it, a definite must for those road trips when you don;t know what facilities will be available to you at your destination.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 ""AA"" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.",5
"Graco Sweet Snuggle Infant Soothing Swing, Jacqueline","We registered for this swing after hearing good reviews from other people and I figured the newer model would have more bells and whistles.  I'm giving it 5 stars due to easy assembly, as the baby hasn't gotten here yet (I'm due in 3 weeks -- and it's still easy to put together) but I anticipate it will do the job it needs to do, which is to hold the baby comfortably for a little while.",5
Graco Swingomatic 6 Speed Swing - Windsor,"I am a first time mother. One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern. I love the Windsor pattern, so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print. I recevied them all. The item I like the least is the swing. It wasn't exactly easy to put together. The mobile was the hardest part. Once you think you get it on, it just keeps falling off. I got so aggravated, I just gave up and kept the mobile off. When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap, no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in. It sure isn't a quiet swing, it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth. It goes through batteries like crazy. My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out. I'm not happy with it at all. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice. I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing, which I love and am completely satisfied with. Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set, you may end up with something you hate :)",2
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"My daughter received this booster seat for her 3rd  birthday and I think it's wonderful.  Every other booster seat I've seen has to be strapped to the chair, which allows crumbs and other food pieces to accumulate under it, and has to be unbuckled every time you need to clean under it.  The Cooshie is made of a non-skid material and stays put on the chair.  Since it doesn't have straps, it becomes very easy to free up the chair for visitors, when necessary, without worrying that there's a pile of crumbs (or worse) underneath.  It's also easy to take this booster to restaurants or other places (it comes with a clear plastic travel bag).  Other boosters tend to be made of hard plastic and can scratch the chair it's attached to.  We have oak chairs, so this was a problem for us.  The Cooshie's soft foam material does not scratch or leave other marks.  At 3 years old, my daughter was at the point where she was too big for the high chair.  She enjoys sitting at the table, but she's just not big enough to reach without kneeling (and she's not yet graceful enough to sit on a chair without taking a tumble every now and then).  The Cooshie raises her high enough without constraining her yet keeps her in a stable sitting position so she doesn't fall or slip off the chair.  It seems to be very durable too.  My 14-month old has 8 front teeth &amp; is currently teething.  He tried to take a  bite out of the Cooshie and didn't even leave a mark!  The only drawback I can see is that my daughter needs to be helped into and out of her seat.  When she was just kneeling on a chair, she was able to climb onto the chair by herself.  A little bit of a damper on her autonomy, but I think the safety and comfort of this booster make it well worth it.  I would continue to use a high chair or a booster with straps for a child who is too young or wreckless to wait for assistance in getting in/out.",5
"Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie",My daughter loves it! I would have preferred the bike to have a seatbelt though.,4
Harlow 5 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set with Bumper by Cocalo Couture,"This bed set was a great buy. It is perfect for the person looking for something that is not pink, purple or pastel. The colors look even better in person than they do online. I just wish I could find the matching hamper to go along with the set.",5
"Status Veneto Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige","This glider seems to be an okay, value driven, piece of furniture.  It does not have the bells and whistles of the other gliders (reclining or locking), but it does have a nursing footstool. It was very easy to put together, I am 8 months pregnant and did it myself in under 20 minutes. Day 2 out of the box it does squeak at a certain point, but I have to try to make it do that, so as long as it doesn't get worse, it will be fine (famous last words, I know). Our nursery is small and this glider fits great.  It is a bit narrower than others but I fit comfortably and can rest my head on the back (pre-prego size 12, 5'6&#34;).",3
"Munchkin Auto-Close Metal Gate, White","In order for this gate to fit stairwells that are greater than a certain width (somewhere around 33""), you have to remove some corner-pieces from inside each corner of the frame, so that additional pieces that are included can be installed to extend it. The removed corner-pieces are then re-inserted. You are expected to pry them out with a screwdriver, and edges in said pieces are provided to offer leverage. The top-corner ones are a cinch. The problem is that the bottom corner ones on mine were wedged in super-tight, and the force/leverage necessary to remove them made the plastic crumble like cold butter when I tried to follow the instructions and pry them out. The edge they provide for leverage literally crumbled to mush on me. When I tried other angles, same thing: again, it was like they used cold butter (trust me, the analogy is dead on) for these plastic pieces. They just disintegrate.I stopped right their. If this is indicative of the sort of design forethought and build quality that went into this gate, it's too dangerous for my child. It makes me a bit ill to think that this sort of junk is permitted on the market for a CHILD SAFETY PRODUCT.Read the other 1-star and 2-star reviews...these plastic pieces seem a common problem, especially if you have to use the extenders like I did. But I'd still warn against this gate even to those who can skip this step, because it's these same pieces that help anchor the gate. Imagine if they gave out when your child was around it.",1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I really needed something to warm my baby's bottle without using the stove or microwave. This was to my surprise faster and easier than any of the two, makes my job a lot easier. I would recommend to busy mothers everywhere.",5
Chuggington Toddler Bedding Set - 4pc Ride Rails Comforter Bed Set,"My 3.5-year-old loves this bed set! Compared to the Thomas the Engine bedding set I got from Wal-Mart (which I love just as much), this one is softer and feels better against the skin, more like cotton and less like polyester. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sheet is already getting those little balls of thread on it that cheap sheets tend to get, and the blanket is too big for a toddler bed, IMO. It makes it hard to make the bed and have it look nice. However, the size is perfect for wrapping up a little kid who wants to feel safe and warm. So, it's not a bad size at all. Just be prepared to fold an end in if you're a perfectionist like me and want to make a nice tailored looking bed. (I have the Orbelle 3-6T toddler bed.)",4
Ikea Baby Bib Set with Sleaves-kladd Prickar,"I have a 2.5 yo and a 15 months old. I was so sick of stains on my kids shirts from eating fruit, that I finally looked into sleeved bibs. There are several options out there, but these are by far the cheapest, in fact, they are half the price. True, they are not really waterproof, but my kids clothes are not getting stained anymore (my main concern is staining, not necessarily getting a little wet). And I can't say that the clothes get all that wet, just slightly around the neckline. Other people mentioned that the material around the sleeves and neckline is stretchy fabric and not at all waterproof, and that is true. The way I have dealt with that is to fold the sleeve once over itself to reveal the actual bib fabric and then there is more protection against wetness. Also, you can wash them by hand and they will be dry by the next mealtime! There is no perfect bib out there, but I have to say these work well and I'm happy with the price. I'm getting another set.",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",I really like this bath pad. My little guy nestles nicely into it and I don't have to worry about him sliding around on it. It's also nice because I can spray it with warm water before I put him on it and it will retain the warmth so it's not a cold shocker on him. Has a nice plastic hanger on the top that is great for hanging it on the shower curtain rod to dry. You really do have to be diligent about drying it and letting all of the surfaces to be exposed to air otherwise it will mold but it can be thrown in the washing machine too.,5

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Deluxe Musical Mobile Gym,"Received as a gift with no gift receipt, so I'm stuck with it.  It has 3 settings: music, music + lights, and music + mobile spins.  Unfortunately, from the very first time I used it the music had a static sound that went along with it.  It distorts the music and unfortuantely you can't use the mobile or lights without music so you have to listen to the static to let the child see the lights or mobile work.  It's infuriating that someone paid a lot of money for this to give us a really nice gift and it's a piece of junk.  Also, the hanging monkey pieces are way too heavy and come apart too easily and fall on my son's head.  The hippo piece is also too hard and like the monkeys gives him a shock when he hits himself with it.  Buy something else.",1
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey",I bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it. She calls it her &#34;soft baby&#34;. It would be great for a younger baby as well.,5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I bought the Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard for our daughter who is turning 10 months old next week. It's a great product, high quality but she hates it. I think it's because she's been moving around so freely for a few months now and for us to now try to ""contain"" her isn't working. We'll just continue to baby proof the house and keep and eye on her.",5
"3 Sprouts Storage Bin, Monkey",Great bin! Solid and good size. Fits a lot of toys and looks beautiful.Highly recommend it to anyone looking to organize.,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","Never have I had such a problem setting something up - I eventually gave up.  The gate is at an angle, so only if you do it just right will it be able to open and close.  Plus you have to use stickers (suppied) for it to stick to the wall. Give me an order baby gate anytime!",1
Dora the Explorer Toddler Nap Mat Pink,"this was so cute online but it it pretty flimsy, wish had more padding and the pillow was better",3
Gerber Nuk Newborn Orthodontic Pacifier Latex Size1 - 2 ea-Colors Vary,"if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides, out will come a collection of 'things' from hair to lint to dry milk...one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple, when I pulled the nipple to the side, the hair still wouldn't come off, so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint...I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and found them dirty as well...since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use, it still collected lint and other things...... I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple, but this isn't enough for these pacifiers...I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $$ back...don't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day...",1
One Dozen (12) Armed Forces Rubber Duck Party Favors,"Good product and relatively inexpensive.  The three sets of four were all in good shape although there were a couple where the painted eyes were off a bit (googly eyes!), but I'm happy with the purchase and the price I paid.",4
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","This is the second one we've purchased. Have tried others, but this is the most versatile and comfortable. It even works well with a two year old - very helpful when traveling with multiple children!",5
Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail,"I bought two guard rails for my 17 month old son who was being transitioned into a twin bed. I have one rail on each side of the bed because his bed is centered in the middle of his room. I had no problem locking the 4 rails (2 per each guard rail) with the exception of 1 and my neighbor was able to help me. I am 6 months pregnant and my husband is gone with the army so I tend to buy things that are easy to assemble and work good without a hassle. This was definately one of those items. It was easy to assemble, they are easy to adjust and lower, and they are safe for my child since they meet the new standards to prevent entrapment. You can't beat that! Lowering the rails to change the bed sheets is easy to do and I have never had a problem lowering or relocking the rails. I follow the directions and nothing on these rails has ever broken. The amount of space on the mattress taken up by the rails is very minimal and I can easily lay on the bed with my son and have extra room even though I'm 6 months pregnant and it's only a twin bed. Last but not least, the guard rails keep my son in bed and never move even though they take a beating from him. Every time I check on him, he is always pushed up against one and the guard rails have never budged. I love knowing he is safe, won't get entrapped like with the possibility of the older model guard rails, and that the product is easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White","I purchased these for my daughter in law to use as burp clothes, and when they arrived I had to laugh!  These things look like cheese cloth. They are so thin you can see right through them! On a good note, they make great dusting rags.",2
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","These door monkeys are genius, kudos to the person who invented these.We used to have problems with our 2 yr old getting into our bedroom and bathroom tearing everything apart.Thanks to the door monkey she can look longer get into those rooms anymore!As a bonus it keeps unwanted pets out as well.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter continues to love this toy at 4 months. When she was a newborn, she took notice of this toy because of the black and white patterns on the back of his wings. It was actually the only toy that seemed to attract her attention at such a young age. Well, at about 2-3 months, she was able to reach out and grab the wings and little arms. I found it fascinating to watch her curl her little fingers around all the different parts. I thought by now she'd be bored of it, but I was wrong. Now at 4 months she's grabbing the rings and teether and putting them in her mouth. She also loves when I squeak the squeaky toy.I highly recommend this toy because it seems to captivate babies at many ages. Just a note, it is quite large and doesn't hang well from my Graco Tour Infant seat (blocks her whole face). However, it attaches very well to her bouncy seat!",5
Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket 2-Piece Gift Set,Item arrived on time and better quality than I expected. Will be gift to baby on the way and we are very pleased with purchase.,5
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"I've bought and am using two other North States Gates and both are excellent, probably a 4 out of 5: North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, and Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate. This gate however is junk.It's incredibly difficult to use. Pehaps if you get lucky, and your walls are just the right size, you can open and close it with one hand easilly, but I discovered if you want to get the gate to close securely without your little one pushing it over, you not only need both hands, you need to get down on the floor and wrestle with it for some time. What a huge disappointment! Once installed, and we realized it was useless, taking it down ended up leaving a damaged wall, as the double sided foam tape behind the plastic mounting cup ripped a chunk of paint off of the wall...nice. What a mistake to buy this junky gate. Perhaps if you need to get a gate up and never open it, this gate would work for you. If not, look elsewhere.",1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"Was hoping to use this to entice baby to latch on, but it didn't work as expected. It was just awkward and didn't work in the way I had expected it to. This was my experience.",3
"Wee Gallery Art Cards for Baby, Sea Collection","These cards are wonderful for young babies. My baby started looking at these at around 6 weeks old- long before he was interested in any toys. We hung them up over his changing table and he was totally mesmerized. They are perfect for bringing along when you leave the house to keep small babies entertained. They hardly take up any room in a diaper bag or purse. At 2 or 3 months, my baby would happily stare at them through a whole meal at a restaurant. Now, at 4 months, he likes to pick them up and chew on them. They are holding up amazingly well. They're made out of a thick sturdy cardboard, like board book pages. I highly recommend these.",5
"Tadpoles Four Bulb Chandelier, Pink","Everything we expected, looks great in our daughters room and produces plenty of of light.Came with everything we needed to install.",5
"Pacipals Huggable Pacifier (Briar the Bunny) --- **UPDATED PACKAGING, SAME GREAT PRODUCT**","Pacimals are lifesavers!!!! My daughter absolutely loves hers. We have 2 pacimals (the bunny and the hippo) and I don't know what I would do without them. The fact that she can hug her bunny and hold on to her pacifier makes it so easy! I don't have to worry that the paci will fall out of her mouth and constantly have to put it back in like other pacifiers. She can do it herself and has been able to do so since she was 1 month old. I constantly get stopped on the street by other mothers and asked where I purchased it. Now, this is a gift I give to every expectant mother.",5
"Kissaluvs Diaper Lotion Potion 4 oz. Squirt Bottle, Concentrate","I purchased this for making a wipe solution, as we cloth diaper and cloth wipe 100%.  Being exclusively breastfed, my baby poops a lot and his little bottom was staying slightly red.  The first time we used this product it immediately cleared up and has been fine since! This solution smells wonderful too.  I will definitely buy more, but I do think the price is a bit high.",4
DEX Products Safety Changing Pad,"This change pad has a pattern all over it which is made up of lots of little grooves. When your baby has a particularly messy nappy and it gets on the pad (it happens!!) then the poop collects in the little grooves and requires scrubbing with a brush to get out. A simple spray and wipe down doesn't suffice and who has time for unnecessary scrubbing when you have a new baby??Also, the plastic surface is very thin and knocking it with my fingernails which aren't even long causes it to tear easily.Yes I could probably buy a cover for it, but it should still be acceptable to use without one, otherwise why sell it like that?I really do not recommend this changing pad at all.",1
SAFETY KNOTTED &amp; CERTIFIED*Amber Heals Baltic Amber Teething Necklace-Raw Honey- with &quot;Amber Heals&quot; Jewelry Pouch,Boys hardly know the necklace is there and we're trusting it does what is claimed. Definitely no harm in trying natural remedies. Hasn't irritated son's eczema either.,5
Piyo Piyo Free Rotate Bottle Scrubber,Broke the first time we used it. Great idea if it had worked.  Seven more words required - don't have any.,1
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"Right around the age of three months, my daughter started to really become interested in the things around her, and Pupsqueak was no exception!  She absolutely loves this toy and we take it everywhere we go.  I can lay her on the floor with this and she will move it back and forth, grab at it, and pull the ring into her mouth.  She absolutely loves the sound the ears make.  A great toy to teach your child grasping!",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"No matter how much I fooled with the little metal thing that came with the carseat, it never seemed tight enough and it was hard to do.  With the mighty tight, you just snap it on and crank it tight.  The seat is in so tight now that it doesn't budge.  I love it so much that I give these as baby shower gifts.  Highly recommend!!",5
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,The unit works just as advertised.  The included AC adapters are great so your not replacing batteries all the time.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Baby shows absolutely no interest in this toy.  Refuses to put it in mouth even though likes gumming on just about everything else.  The giraffe has a chalky rubbery texture so I can understand why.  We use it as a squeeker.  I like that it is made in France.,2
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,I like the size of these blankets but they are not as soft as I thought they would be. I found a off brand set at the store that were so much softer and half the price.,3
"Stork Craft Hillcrest Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Espresso",Love this crib. Looks exactly like it does in the photo and it was very easy to assemble. Great value for the price.,5
"Maxi Cosi Rodi AP Booster Car Seat, Origami Rose","The plastic material used on this seat feels a little cheap, but it also makes the seat light and easy to install. This is a great option for putting in and out of cars, whereas my Graco Argos is heavy and more difficult to remove. Also, this Maxi Cosi allows for a highback booster option of up to 120 lbs (weight of child) whereas the Graco Argos highback option only goes up to 100 lbs.Keep in mind that this seat uses your automobile's buckle system. It doesn't have one of its own. That means, for most cars, you need to install it on one side of the automobile or the other -- not the center/middle. The negative with this is that the center provides the most safety should there be an accident; side impacts are less likely to reach that far into the cab. For example, if you have the booster installed on the passenger side of the car, and someone rams into the passenger side, there's more of a chance your child will be injured. For this reason, I prefer using a car seat that has it's own buckle system so that I can keep it in the center -- but even those only go up to about 65 lbs (weight of child) before you need to start using the automobile's buckle system. That said, the Maxi Cosi does provide some side impact protection even if it is not installed in the center of the car, which is safer than having none.If you want a seat that says in the car permanently, and takes advantage of the center of the vehicle, something like the Graco Argos is a more durable option. But if you want something that you can easily put in and take out of the car, or swap in and out of more than one car, the Maxi Cosi is a good choice.",4
"Playtex Disney Playhouse Insulator Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors and Styles May Vary","Adorable little cups.... I love these cups! I used them for my daughter and now for my son and they are perfect easy to drink out of, they don't leak (which is a plus), and they last a long time even after multiple throws and drops! A++++",5
MOBI TykeLight Green,"I wanted to rate this product with five stars.  My six month old does love the glow of the light, and I find it fun myself.  However, I thought I was ordering the unit with the base, as that was what was pictured.  I was very disappointed to find that I received the one that plugs directly into the unit.  I emailed Beach Audio to find out why I got the wrong one.  They discovered that there is a mix up with listing and picture.  I was told that it will be fixed with Amazon, and I was offered a postage paid return label for shipping it back.  I am choosing to keep the light I have.  Be aware of that one detail, but if something does go wrong, the people at Beach Audio will take care of it!  :)",4
Carter's I Love My Mom Baby Boy's Bear Blankie,"All that matteres is that my baby girl likes it, no difference if it's for a boy or girl, she don't know gender or color difference yet, so it was perfect for her, she sleeps with it all the time.",4
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes","I had owned a Britax carseat and was prepared to purchase Britax again.  After taking a look at this carseat I decided to purcahse two of these instead.  I am very pleased with the quality and the ease of installation.  My granddaughters (ages 2 and 4) are both very comfortable in the seats. I have, thankfully, not had the ultimate test of any carseat, which would be an accident.  My experience with this seat has been positive and I would buy these again.",5
"Carter's Burp Cloths, Mommy Loves me Yellow","Our baby wasn't a hugh spitter-upper. We love these burp cloths. They are so sturdy, and comfy on the skin too. They really held up over many washes. If we had a baby who spat up more we might opt for something that was larger, but they were perfect for us.",5
"Badger Basket Two Hamper Set with Liners, Natural","I needed a garbage can in the kitchen that would look nice sitting out. I could have gotten the wood one and paid 2 to 3 times as much for one! I have a regular kitchen can inside the larger basket for the kitchen. The prior reviews about it being cheaply made are not accurate. These are baskets, and as such not like iron, but it is a sturdy basket with a nice lid! Perfect for my needs!",5
Cotton Tale Designs Paradise 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I looked everywhere for this bedding.  Everyone that sold it was selling out very very fast! Found and bought it from Amazon, and it was shipped very quick!  The packaging was great and the bedding was beautiful!  We are having a boy and loved this!  Such vibrant colors and just gorgeous!!!  Cannot wait to set it up in the crib next month!!!!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","The Baby Bjorn gets rave reviews for good reason.  It is a great product - don't be fooled by imitators.  I tried others with my first child and hated them.  They were too difficult to get on and to get the baby into and not particularly comfortable on my back and shoulders.  The Baby Bjorn on the other hand is awesome!  The design makes it relatively simple to load your baby in and the crisscross back with adjustable slide is about as comfortable as you can get.  I also love my sling but there are times when the Bjorn is just more practical.  Like when dashing through airports making connecting flights.  And wandering through tiny shops where a stroller won't fit.  And it was very handy keeping my son secured to me when we went elephant trekking in Thailand.My toddler is probably pushing it for the weight limit but I still occasionally use it and he is now 16 months old and 26 pounds.  (Some versions have 22 lb weight limits but others (mine included) are a bit higher.)  Carrying around a 26 pound baby isn't the most comfortable thing in the world no matter how you do it but this carrier sure makes it easier.  Best of all, in spite of being a curious and active wandering toddler he actually still enjoys being in it on those occasions when I do need to use it.It may seem expensive compared to other brands but buy a Baby Bjorn carrier.  It is definitely money well spent!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie the Giraffe is the perfect teething toy. She is soft, makes squeaky sounds in both her head and body, and is just right for tiny little fists. My son loves to chew on her ears, horns, and legs. The day she arrived he was cutting a new tooth and just gnawed her a ton. She is really well made, and my older children love to play with her too. When I ask them to get my son a toy, they always pick Sophie. The only downside to Sophie is the cost. I priced out a number of other teething toys, and Sophie was definitely one of the most expensive. After having Sophie for a month though, I would still recommend her. She is worth the price and is one of the few toys that we have that are actually worth what we paid for them.",5
Disney Car's &quot;Little Racer&quot; Musical Mobile,"I read some of the reviews so I knew people said it looked a little cheap. I think the plastic feels a little cheap but once I put it together, which I was scared I would break it I had to be forceful to get get it together. But once it was together and I put it on the Crib I did like the look of it and it looks so cute with the bedding and matching Wall decals I bought :)",4
Single Animal Jingle Bell (Assorted Styles),Brought for 3 years old grandchildren. We have started our own marching band. Quality was excellent and it was a teaching tool as well.,5
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont",I wished I could sit in the chair. It seems very comfortable for my toddler and easy to strap into the car. Was a bit pricey to clear in customs but that may have been due to the country I reside in. The cost on Amazon itself was very reasonable.,4
Infant Carseat Canopy Cover 3 Pc Whole Caboodle Baby Car Seat Cover Kit Cotton C030100,Absolutely loved it. It was just like picture! The material was very nice. I would recommend I you are looking for a stylish cover!!,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow",We co-sleep and use these in bed so that if the babies have an accident it doesn't ruin our sheets. We also use them on the changing pad so that we don't have to change the entire cover every time there's a messy diaper and we use them when we visit my parents and need to put the kids down on their nice sofa or rug. We have about 10 of these so that we don't run out and they are fantastic.,5
Monthly Baby Stickers Monthly Tie Stickers Boy Necktie Neck Tie UNCUT Nautical Sailor Boat Anchor Plaid Argyle Stripes Waves Plaids,These bowties are a cute and unique twist on the popular monthly stickers for babies.  The sticker works well and look super cute on my little man.  My only complaint is that a couple of the stickers are hard to read with the color of the font and the background design.,4
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","I'm on my third kid and 5th diaper pail.  My fourth pail was a Diaper Genie Elite that worked great until my son shoved his hand into the inside of the pail and broke a piece of it, and it no longer opened with the foot pedal.  I replaced it with the same pail (Diaper Genie Elite), and this one doesn't seem to have the same odor protection as my last one.  No idea why.  I hate that you have to buy the bags for this (unless you do a hack, which I've heard does not offer the same odor protection at all).  I used a Diaper Champ for a few years and this is far better.  It's easy to use, easy to change, seems to fill up pretty quickly because the bags are so narrow, but from my experience, this is the best pail to keep stink out of your nursery, and messes contained to ONLY the plastic diaper pail lining.  The others have a plastic &#34;pass through&#34; that the diaper touches before going in to plastic, which obviously gets dirty after some poop-splosion clean up jobs.  And Costco now carries the refill bags for less money than Amazon ;)",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","This sheet is too small for my Da Vinci mini crib.  Also, the material is very thin. I do not recommend these sheets.",1
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This was a gift;  The concept is cool, but it did not work well with our wood floors (kids could not 'scoot' kaboosted chair in and out) and their legs were squished between the chair (normal dining set) and table 'ledge' (which is less than 4"" tall).  Ages 2 and 4.",2
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",Love this little bag - my son adores it! The only thing I would change is to have a toggle on the outside drink pocket for tightening as well as to add a double zipper on the main compartment.....I really find single zippers a pain in the butt!,3
DaVinci Sleepwell Twilight 6-Inch Ultra Firm Deluxe Crib Mattress,It's firm enough for my baby which I was looking for. It fits the crib right and I am happy with it until now.,5
"NUK Gerber Graduates Learning System Sports Learning Cup Tumbler, Baseball, 9-Ounce",Bought it for my 15 month old. Still his favorite after 3 months. He knew right away where the spout was. Best part ... They dont leak. I can leave water in it in his crib and not come back to a puddle.,5
Knickernappies Doorknob Diaper Pail (celery),The snaps that are supposed to go above the door knob already gave out under the weight of one child's couple days worth of diapers. But I have figured out how to snap it a different way so the outer snaps are above the door and bear the weight. Overall it isn't a bad product...but it could be a bit sturdier for it's purpose...if the other snaps fail I'll just use it in a pail.,3
"Kushies &quot;On the Go&quot; 2 Pack Wet Bag, Green  (Patterns and Colors May Vary)","These wetbags are not great.  They seep moisture, and they only fit about 3 or 4 cloth diapers in them.  I wasn't upset by the small size, because I thought they would be great for my diaper bag... until I used them and they leaked right through.  I would not recommend these for wet diapers. I also got a PlanetWise wetbag, and it is AWESOME! Check those out instead!",2
Slip-X Solutions Tub Tattoos: Clownfish,Super whimsical characters. I bought all the series and love it. Very colorful! This will even give me spares should any peel up. So far standing up to hundreds of showers and lots of cleanings. Don't use a scrub brush cleaning these or risk peeling them up! A good firm sponge works just fine,5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Brush,"I see where people had a lot of issues and I barely purchased one because of them but I actually Love the brush. Mine has not torn up at all, I like the sponge tip for the bottom of the bottle floor. Especially for breastmilk which has a lot of fat... If you get a brush with a prickly brush head and not a sponge... then it misses areas on the bottom of the bottle floor. It will stay greasy no matter what liquid you use.. By the way, Palmolive Baby works magic and leaves the bottles squeaky clean.For hygiene purposes I switch my brush out monthly as I wash several bottles daily... I also ""after"" it dries out, I use a zip lock bag on the tip of it to keep it sterile.Palmolive Ultra, Baby Bottle, Toy, & Dish Wash Liquid 20 fl oz (591 ml)",5
"NUK Transparent Silicone BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2, 2 Pack","My son loves this pacifier.. he will not take anything but this one. Not even the other nuk ones. It is not sold  in stores which is a bit of a headache. You can only find them on amazon. Also they do blend into the background , which can make it hard to find in the middle of the night, but it does look better because it is clear. It matches every outfit.",5
Cribskirt Tailored Dust Ruffle 14 inches long 100% cotton WHITE,"Ordered the nice, clean white.  Arrived as described.  Looks great in a modern nursery because of its clean lines.  No frilly, lacey, ruffly stuff to deal with.  No complaints.",5
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I received a confirmation 2 days after ordering this product that it had ""shipped."" Two weeks later, it still hadn't arrived. I called Medical for You (the distributor) and they said they'd get back to me. Two days later, I got an email telling me it was on back order. All in all, it took over 3 weeks to get this product. My baby was barely crawling when I first paid for it, and was all over the place by the time I got the play yard. If you get this product, you might try purchasing it straight from Regalo (the manufacturer).That being said, the product itself is great. After reading reviews of other play yards, it seemed like plastic ones had some safey issues (ex: being too light and tipping over, falling apart easily, etc.), so I went with the metal one. So far, it has been worth the money. There's a lot of room for my 7 month old to roll and crawl around. I can get in there with her and we have plenty of room to play. It's sturdy and I never worry that it will tip over or collapse, even when she rolls into the side of the play yard. The door on the side is a great feature, because I don't have to step over the top to get in. It is fairly large, so you may not want this product if you have a small living room (or small space wherever you plan to set it up).Over all, I would completely recommend this product to parents looking to keep their mobile babies safe in a confined but spacious area. I just hope nothing breaks, because I'd have to deal with their customer service again :(",4
Parking Pal Car Magnet - Parking Lot Safety for Children (Flower Pal),"I have a 3 year old and 4 year old and I've always been concerned about them listening in the parking lot.  I've been lucky that they usually listen very well and we hadn't had any problems...until last week when it was windy and something blew out of the car into the parking lot and my 3 yo ran after it to get it for me!  Luckily there were no cars at the moment but it definitely put me in panic mode!  After calming down I thought I needed a new way to keep them together so we didn't have any repeats of the other day!I got my parking pal a few days ago and tried it out for the first time today!  My kids loved it!  Instead of fighting over who got in the car first they were fighting over who got to ""play the game""!  They literally wanted to stop at more stores so that they would each get turns doing it!  They loved telling me the animals and colors on the parking pal and keeping their hand right on the hand spot while I put the other one in the car!  My youngest even said, ""Mommy, it's so cool"" :)I would highly recommend this product to other moms with toddlers and will be ordering another one so that I can have one on each side of the car instead of having to remember whose turn it is!",5
Kidco Universal Outlet Cover,"The product does not lie flush with the wall, meaning that your plugs (unless they happen to have really, really long prongs - which none of mine did) will not be able to reach deeply enough to get power.  Get the Mommy's Helper Safe Plate instead.  That one actually works.",1
Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy,"This very funny monkey, sent very fast, and is a joy for my grandson and me - for him as a pet, for me guiding him safe in the city. He, as a vivid toddler is running very quickly, and I as a more slow walker can hold him  secure, when he wants to reach the interesting cars on streets and roads, without knowing about any danger.  May be some people think, that I am &#34;gaga&#34; holding him in such a way,  older people show sympathy and understanding...At home the little boy often caresses this smiling soft animal with likeness.Thank you so much !",5
Sliding Door Locks,"These have worked well to keep our twin toddlers from opening the sliding closet doors.  Our childcare provider, on the other hand, has broken two of them because she forces the doors without thinking about pushing the wings in.  Fortunately, they still work with only one wing!  For those who have bad reviews, I wonder if the wings were on backward.  Notice the direction of the straight vs angled sides.  Also, I'd suggest using a better adhesive for longevity.  We'd buy again; in fact, we have already.",4
"Status Series 300 Combo Storage Unit, Mahogany",Furniture arrived with no problems. Very little to assemble. Doors didn't quite fit perfectly but everything else works great! Just the right height to put a changing station on top - plenty of room. Matches crib perfectly.,5
"Tadpoles Multi-Layer Tulle Curtain Panel, White",They are see through so keep that in mind. We liked them a lot though. My daughter really thought they were cool,5
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"This playmat is awesome! Super cute, easy to clean and provides the best protection for your little ones!! Adding this to your baby's room will automatically brighten it up and the room will look so cute! This type of playmat is very popular with Koreans and since I am Korean, I knew I would eventually buy one of these when I got pregnant. I was honestly skeptical about the Pingko mat because it is so much cheaper compared to the other brands I have seen at the store. A normal mat like this would cost around $160. So naturally, I went out to the Korean store and bought one for $160 because I assumed this mat was inferior due to the price. Stupid assumption! Couple of months later, I decided I wanted another mat for the living room but didn't want to shell out the $160 so I ordered this. I knew this mat was slightly smaller but that was fine since it was an extra mat. I have to say, the colors and pictures on this are so vibrant and much cuter than the first one I bought! Wish I had tried this first! The size difference is hardly noticeable. I honestly couldn't tell that this was smaller just by looking at it. Please don't hesitate and try it!P.S. - My mat did have a smell when it arrived and it drove me crazy. A week later, the smell was still there and I was debating if I should return it. I took it outside, washed it with laundry detergent and water, dried it in the sun and the smell disappeared completely. I was shocked. I thought the smell would come back after a day or two but it didn't. It got rid of it 100%. Since the smell is gone, I am completely satisfied with this product.",5
"Jahgoo Bath Support Baby Bath Seat, Lime",I ordered this for my friend for her baby. It came and I almost laughed at the size of the box. This this is so small that yes it works for a new born but if your baby is over 7 lbs it wont work for long! It looks very neat but is not practcle for long.,2
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","We had originally used a different brand infant sound machine with our daughter, and searched for something better because it had several issues, including all but one awful &#34;white noise&#34; sounds, volume control, no power outage backup, and no way to tell if the timer button had been pushed, either accidentally by us or on purpose by our daughter (meaning several nights of us having to sneak in and turn it back on after it had shut off). This sound machine completely solved all of those issues--awesome, true white noise sounds that seem soothing, quality controls, and battery backup. The blue light it emits isn't too bright for our daughter's room, although we choose to not use the night-light function for now. A couple of the white noises are more nature oriented, one with a whale sound and the other with crickets. Although an adult may find this soothing, we don't think they would be to our toddler, so we don't ever use those. The music option is nice, offering classical music we can listen to while winding down for bedtime after bath. The auxiliary jack is great, too, but we rarely use it because that would mean making sure the iPod is charged...not a priority for us at the time, but a nice option, nonetheless.",5
Ubooly iPhone and iPod Interactive Pet,"We all know how kids love cute little things that are cuddly and that they can pretend are their very own ""pets"". We also know how much kids love technology and are constantly begging to use our iPhones or iPads. So I was very excited when I heard about this adorable new fuzzy guy... Ubooly!Ubooly came with instructions on how to download the Ubooly app to your iPhone or iTouch device and a code to enter to activate your new little ""buddy"". After that you just insert your device into the plush character and zip it up. One of my favorite things about Ubooly is that when I turn my (very expensive) device over to my kids to play with- it is all zipped up in a very plush and cushy protective covering. So that makes me feel a bit better when my kids leave the room giggling with Ubooly in hand.When you first start playing with Ubooly- your little guy starts asking questions, ""Would you like to hear a joke?"" or ""Would you like to listen to music?"" and your kids are answering and treating Ubooly as if he is a real live creature! But my favorite thing I've seen so far is when Ubooly had a case of the hiccups! My kids were hysterical- AND concerned! They kept telling Ubooly to hold his breath!I am really impressed with the technology.... that the app is programmed for Ubooly to listen to a series of responses and react accordingly. It makes him seem so real- even I wanted to hang around and see what he would say next! I was especially pleased when Ubooly started telling my kids some facts about the moon- how far away it is, etc.... (Yes, Ubooly is educational!) And the other cool thing is that the app updates monthly with new activities (using your devices Wifi connection)- so he evolves and grows along with your kids!",5
"Sunshine Kids Radian Travel Bag, Black","we had purchased the old style sunshine kids travel bag for our radian 65 and found it way over sized & cumbersome. THIS bag, on the other hand, fits our carseat like a skin, has a cinch strap, and backpack straps that are very comfortable. also has a handy strap on top. the hardware is metal & appears to be fairly strong. i wish we had bought this one first and not wasted our money on the old version. this version is much improved and worked very well for us when we checked the carseat.",5

"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","Great seat.  The generous head supports are just what we needed.  in this seat he remains upright while sleeping, looking very secure and peaceful.  He keeled over while sleeping in other seats we have tried (the cheap evenflo amp was one we had prior).I am happy with the fit in our compact car - i have a bmw 328 sportwagon it is very compact in the back seat area and the way the seats are molded I wasnt sure what booster would fit best (meaning would i forever be scraping my hands to wrestle to get out stuck underneath and would the carseat be tippy because of the molding etc)",5
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"I looked around at a lot of monitors and liked this one the most. It has good signal range, the color on the screen is great, and the best part is that I can talk to my son. Most of the other monitors are similiar to this one except for the ""talking back"" feature.The one drawback is the camera seems cheaply made and sometimes doesn't send a signal to the base monitor.",3
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),This is a really cool product with lots of features.  It even measures the ambient temperature.

"Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers, Pink Dot","I love these! The orange dots are too adorable. It fits over the closet pole well and slides very easily. I love the fact that they come with multiple sticker labeling options such as 3-6 months or day of the week, etc. With an infant, they are a big help in keeping his clothes organized and separated by size. I will be using these for years to come.",5

Mamas &amp; Papas 2013 Pixi Highchair - Raspberry,"This is my 3rd child, hence my 3rd high chair...I only wish I would've had this chair with my other kiddos. It cleans up So so easy....no crevices to get crumbs out of...no padding to take apart, and so far( 4months of use) no discoloration on padding or tray...the legs stick out a little and when I feed I can't scoot my chair right up to her but I manage just fine. Another thing I noticed is that the bottom is very scuffed already...since the base is white it picks up easily...Love that it is small and folds up very easily! I would by again and again if I have more children",5
"American Baby Company 3-Pack 100% Cotton Terry Washcloth Set, Blue",These are very soft on baby.  They are also extra big for baby.  Normal baby cloths are too small.  These are perfect.,5
,"I gave this a rating of 5 because it's great in that it is sturdy, great size and height, and is easy to maneuver in and out of, that said, it's very cumbersome, awkward and frustrating to put together.  The attaching parts could be made for ease of joining instead of being so manual and complicated.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This is my 6 month old's new favorite toy.  He likes the crinkly noise and the many colors.,5
Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat in Regal,Me and my son both LOVE this seat. It is so comfortable that every time he gets in it he's asleep within 5 minutes! It's like a miracle seat for us! With his last seat he would whine and fuss the whole time in the car and could never get comfortable; with this seat it's the complete opposite.,4
Carter's Jungle Jill 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"For my granddaughters bed, it looks so cute, it matches all the colors and animals we needed. I wish it was just a little bigger because we are using it on a toddlers bed.. I guess it is better for a crib, even though a toddlers bed is the same size. we needed it more for a bedspread, but it works.",5
"Nuby Bug A Loop Teether Bead, Colors May Vary","My 3 month old will use this teether, while most others are just a bit bigger, and too big for his hands to hold onto easily (and he's a big boy).  This one has different shapes, colors, textures and sizes on it that he enjoys.  It also has little bugs with wings that stick out for him to nibble on.  I like that it is free of harmful chemicals and safe for baby.",5
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,I have two grandchildren (7 & 3) and have had this brand since the oldest was two. Through natural wear I had to replace them about six months ago. Replaced with another brand that just did not do the job. Searched and found the original I had used and working like a charm!,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"ALL Diaper contraptions smell.  Don't buy into the hype that this one prevents the diapers from smelling less.  When I empty the thing - most of the wrapped packages come undone, which can be irritating.  It took me a month to figure out how to change the darn bag also.  After 5 months I am still not doing it right each time.  (And I do computer coding...How is it this diaper pail has me searching for the badly written directions all the time?!)  My son's messy diapers are VERY messy and since you have to push the diaper or wipes WAY down in there - I'm usually getting muck on my hand.  I can see why some like this Genie and others don't but I'm headed back to the store.  ONE PLUS:  you can find the replacement bags all over the place because it's so popular.",3
Cradle Mattresses - Size 15x33,I bought this item to replace the original mattress that came with my cradle.  I received the cradle as a gift over 25 years ago and I'm now passing it on to my daughter.  This mattress fits exactly like the original.,5

"Halo Sleepsack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Medium Pink Argyle","Thevquality of the sleep sack is great. I love the argyle and the butterfly is very cute.  My little girl sleeps in these every night. The fleece one gets a little warm, so we use the regular clothe one more often.  A great baby shower gift would be a newborn, small & medium. Sleep sacks, year one!I recommend more than one, of course, so one can be used and another in the wash.",5

"Summer Infant 2 Pack Waterproof Mattress Pad Protectors, White, 18&quot; x 27&quot;","I bought these to put under the sheet in my daughter's pack and play, and they work great. One pad doesn't fill up the whole platform, but it's large enough that she'd have to roll over, hug a side wall and overflow her diaper for it to miss. They also fit in the co-sleeper when we were still using that.",5
"Dream On Me Baby Bather Bath Tub Stand, Gray",no reason to seat on the floorall over Europe babies bath tub is on stand. no reason to band if you can stand,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"If you buy it, make sure you take it out of the box immediately and use it for a few days (pre-baby) to make sure it works.  The company will only take it back for 30 days (and time flies once the baby arrives).I bought this a week before the baby was born, when I opened it 2 weeks later I realized all the problems that it had.  I used it for 5 days when the display started flipping and freezing.The frozen picture is really a problem because you think you are watching baby nap, but you only see the frozen picture.  Its scary to think you are watching baby sleep safely, only to find that baby has wiggled to a new place in the crib.  This has potential to be quite dangerous!I called the customer service/ tech support number and was hung up on repeatedly.  I left 3 messages over 3 weeks time and never got a return call.  I finally emailed and they said it was too late to return it for a full refund.  I got a partial refund (minus the cost for me to ship the unit back) and bought a different monitor.The audio is the only thing that worked consistently, $100 is a lot to spend for an audio only monitor.",1
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine","Love this car seat, the colors on line do not do it justice...... Its amazing and perfectly matches the baby stroller....  Sucks I had to order as separate pieces due to the size limit for overseas.  But none the less love it and im sure my wife will be extremely surprised when we due the Baby Shower.....",5
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, White, Narrow",This rail cover was SUPER easy to put on and fits like a glove!  My son started chewing on his crib and I worried about him ingesting paint so I decided to look for a product that would protect both him and the crib.  This is a great product.  It blends in nicely with our white crib and it's nice and soft.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I don't have a dishwasher, so this saves me the hassle of having to boil water and sterilizing.  It says that everything inside will remain sterilized as long as you keep the lid on.  But then how will it all get dried?  That's the only down side.  You're suppose to take out the water after 2 minutes, but you have to leave the lid off or else the water won't evaporate.  When you boil water to sterilize, the water inside the bottles evaporate much more quickly.  This uses steam, so condensation is still left inside the bottles.  Just so you know.  Don't get me wrong, I like it a lot and it saves me time, I use it to sterilize my bottles and pump parts every night.  Just wished it allowed the water to evaporate more quickly.",4
"NUK Disney Winnie the Pooh 5 Ounces Learner Cup Silicone Spout, 6+ Months (Pack of 4)",these cups are great for toddlers learning to drink.  The double handle makes it easy to handle for them and less spills.  Love the pooh design on the outside.,5
"Ikko Bassinet Pad- Small, White",This pad fit perfect for my massenet and I love how thick it is. Can't wait to be able to use it in the coming months =) only bad thing was it was a few days late in being delivered.,5
"Ameda 2 Pack Breast Pump Valves,",I was hesitant to buy these because I don't have an Ameda or Medela pump. I have the purple double electric lansinoh breast pump. These fit great and worked great when I used them on my lansinoh pump. I'm so glad these are available to buy because sometimes they wrip. Thank you Ameda!,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"I'm clumsy.  Maybe it's because we have twins and i didn't sleep much for three years.  Anyway, i've dropped this monitor probably a dozen times, and it STILL works flawlessly.  As other reviewers have noted, it is free of static (unlike the earlier monitors we tried), you can put it on voice-activated to filter out background music/noise, and it is extremely sensitive to our children's quietest sounds (turning over in bed, light snoring, yawns).  Even after four years of continuous use, and many drops on the floor, it still works very well, although the rechargeable battery is nearing the end of its lifespan.  To solve the two-monitor dilemna, we eventually bought a second set so we could have one for each child, and we use a different setting for each.  One other plus from its excellent sound quality -- now that our babies are older, we get to enjoy the cheerful sounds of their voices making up morning songs as they wake up.",5
"Lillian Rose Diaper Bag, Building The Foundation Daddy, 17.5&quot; x 6&quot; x 12.5&quot;","I ordered this to give to my son-in-law and couldn't be more pleased!

The picture just doesn't come close to showing how nice it is.",5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping bag, Butterflies, Large",I wanted to get a sleep sack for my granddaughter that was light weight so she would just have enough material to snuggle with but not feel hot in. This product was exactly what I needed!,5
Lamaze Celeste Play &amp; Grow,Great gift for new mothers and baby girls.  My daugter loved her smily sunny face and we put it in her crib and stroller.  She has outgrown the toy but it has been passed on to our niece who loves it.  Toy has lasted more than 5 years so far and is easy to clean.,5
Sealy Tender Vibes Soothing Mattress,This mattress fit perfectly into our crib.  Batteries are easy to get to but screwed in so that small hands cannot get to them. Vibration feature is strong enough to be felt through bedding without shaking the baby too much.,5
Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix),"This is one of the greatest inventions ever!! Makes cloth diapering so easy. Has a little clip at each end similar to an ace bandage (But not pointy, although they still recommend putting a diaper cover over when using these) You just clip it to one end, the other and then down the middle and the diaper stays in place. They are great and so easy. I wouldn't do without them!!",5
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice 8 Second Digital Thermometer,"this thermometer beeps when it is done taking the temperature and works fine under the arm or orally. but, for some reason, when done rectally, it has never beeped to let me know the temp taking is complete - it just shuts itself off after 10-15 seconds. very frustrating as i'm trying to get newborn's temp to know if i need to take her in or not and i'm never assured that i'm getting an accurate reading. for oral or underarm it is fine.",2
Elegant Baby Cotton Cable Knit Teddy Bear - Pink,I would have to agree with another customer that this teddy is not as cute when you see it in person and the size seems smaller.  I do however like the fact that the eyes and nose are sewn in which prevents any choking hazards.  I bought the all white teddy and it goes well with my modern nursery!,3
Mam Bottles BPA Free w/Silk Nipple - 11 oz (Single Pack) (Blue),We absolute love this bottles from the beginning for our son. I liked the way they designed it. I never had leaking issues and cleaning was so easy. He loved it so much. I wished they made sippy cup too.,5
Sassy Soft Grip Comb &amp; Brush,"I have used both the brush and the comb on our newborn.  The bristles on the brush are so soft, he likes the massage, and it helps rid his head of the cradle cap.  The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!",5
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,This product worked well for the first few months. After a while the screen on the monitor began to flicker on and off. It became more and more frequent untill it quit working altogether. We took it back to the store where we got it and the representative said he has seen many come back due to problems.,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle / Foot Finder Set of 4 (2 Wrist 2 Footies),He was a tiny baby and didn't really get much use out of this.  I know of other babies that have this set and loved them. I think it depends on how active the baby is.,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Im not sure how the previous commenter's son ended up upside down. My mother bought this rocker for my son when he was born, and in the past five months he has just loved it. I put it in the kitchen so he can watch me cooking from a safe distance, and have something to entertain him.THeres really no way for the rocker to flip, as it has plastic knobs on the bottom front and back that prevent it from rocking all the way back or forward. Also, theres a metal frame in the front that can flip out and it forces the chair to stay still, if you dont want the rocking. my son, who is 20 lbs can easily rock it on his own by just kicking his feet, which he loves. Sometimes I use the stationary position when Im trying to feed him.It wasnt until just a few weeks ago that he actually began to reach out and pull the middle string to cause the ""if youre happy and you know it"" song to play. I personally thik that the song plays very loud and shrill, but i guess babies like high pitched music. Also, it takes a pretty hard pull to activate the song, which is why he was not able to do it before 4 1/2 months. It would have been nice if the two outside animals would make a noise too when pulled.I especially like that the hanging toys arc can easily be removed and the chair can transition long into toddlerhood as a big boy rocker even after he starts to walk and can get in and out himself.THe bright colors are very vibrant and mine has not faded at all. THe material is soft and sturdy. Also, the metal frame seems to be very strong and durable.All in all, i think its a great chair for newborns to toddlers and look forward to getting much more use out of it.",5
"Rhoost Edge Table Corner Protector, 4 Pack, Black","These corner covers are great, they fit nice and there's not glue or tape to mess up my stained hope chest.",5

Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,This little toy bag is amazing!  It holds a TON and I mean a TON of toys and never falls off the wall.,5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",My kids love washing their hands. Playing with soap and water is an ongoing activity in my house. The problem is that my 2 year old has a hard time reaching the water even on her tip toes and on a step stool. This is the best product ever. I think it is a great idea and solves the problem most parents experience with handwashing. I bought one to try it out but will definitely buy one for all of my bathroom sinks.,5
"Evenflo Cozy Sleeves - 4 oz - 1 pk, Girl Color",I was very pleased to see the item arrive in just a few days.  I was worried if the item would fit the bottles and if my daughter would be able to put it on the bottles easily.  It fit the bottle perfectly and she did get it on the bottle without a struggle.  She was also amazed how she had a better grip on the glass bottle.,5
Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,"These wipes were so thin and flimsy I felt like I was wiping my baby's bottom with tissues. It took me four or five wipes to clean up a mess that other wipes could tackle in one or two. They were soft, sure, but they had no grippy texture and were really just ineffective at cleaning up poo. Donated to Goodwill after trying just a few times. Learn from my mistake! (The wipes I finally ended up liking were the GroVia ones. They were a bit rougher to start with but have really softened up over time.)",1
"Baby Trend Nursery Center Playard, Safari Kingdom",We use this daily while our newborn sleeps in our room at night. I find it very durable though the mobile isn't very secure and will fall off most times if it's bumped by a hand or arm when picking your infant up. I also find the diaper holder easier for use inside the pack n play outside diapers seem to fall out on the floor but for a basic pack n pay I love it and the bassinet is great,4
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"This mobile keeps my 1 month old interested, but the quality of the product is undesirable. The top card does not form a nice 90 degree with the bottom once it is inserted.  We only wish the cards can be a little easier to change.",3
"Playtex DisneyInsulator Spout Cup, Finding Nemo, 9 Ounce, 2-Count","Not only is the price good, but these sippy cups are durable. The spout is hard plastic so you don't have to worry about your toddler biting through them. They use the same stoppers as the soft plastic playtex handled sippy cups so once your toddler bites through those ones, you can still use the stoppers for this cup. Drinks do stay colder for longer and my daughter loves the &#34;fish&#34; cup!",5
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"I put the infant car seat in the bag to test it out and the zipper broke that minute. I would caution anyone wanting to buy this. There are drawstring options available, try that.",1
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-lite Stroller, Denny Red","Here are a few interesting tidbits I didn't come across in the product reviews before my purchase:- The wheels are made of soft rubber (not hard plastic) which helps smooth the ride in addition to the springy suspension.- There is a huge white tag on the back, similar to the ones you find on a mattress that says if you cut it off you will go to prison (ok, anyone except the consumer).  This gigantuan tag just describes the polyester material and it was fun to cut it off with scissors.- Keep the baby's hands away while folding.  The first time I tried to fold it, I pinched my pinkie finger in the Velociraptor of the frame - OUCH!!- Made in China (I don't like this, hopefully it is more durable than most Chinese manufactured products).I'm glad I got this one instead of the G-Luxe version.  The wheels are large enough for urban use, and the recline is not worth the extra weight for me.  For real off-roading I have a Baby Jogger stroller, and it is nice to have two wildly different size strollers at the opposite ends of the spectrum.",4
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Has a basic nightlight, projection light with three pattern disks, and multiple sounds.  Nature, lullabies, classical music and heartbeat are various noises to get your baby or child to sleep.  Has a timer to cut off, and is voice activated by unhappy baby if he or she were to wake up.  Love that it cuts right back on.  Great product.",5
Disney Winnie the Pooh Lovie Blanket,My one year old grand daughter loves to cuddle down with this Pooh Bear. It's small and just right in the car seat or the crib.,4
"Kissaluvs Marvels One Size Fitted Diaper, Mocca Swirl","I won two of these in a FB drawing and love them.  I already had the contours, one size, and wet bags from Kissaluvs.  I think they are a great company with excellent customer service.  I had an issue with one of my marvel one size dipes and they worked quickly to correct it.  These fitteds are my favorite, I only wish they had this print in an all in one diaper!! Its too cute to keep covered!  Super absorbant.  I love that the company makes its products in the US and that its family owned.  Great company with exceptional products.  I just bought the wipes solution and can't wait to use it.",5

Avon Kids Car Desk Light &amp; Write Portable Work Play Space Children Arts &amp; Crafts Free Sitckers,"Okay, big road trip coming up this summer with two four year olds, been looking for something like the Alex car Valet and found this new on eBay for only $7.99 plus 4.99 shipping, so way better than the $32 being quoted here, and please note that this originally sold for $14.99 directly from Avon exclusively.  Anyway, I was intrigued by this car desk because it came with a light for reading when it is dark (tired of letting the kids have the dome light on) and it has a dry erase board which seemed like it would provide a stiff enough surface for writing/drawing on, I had read some reviews of the Alex Car Valet that complained about the writing surface not being strong enough to support writing/drawing.  I will admit that the fact that the Alex Car Valet was crash tested is appealing, but I will say, that while this is a dry erase board, it is still a little flexible, how flexible in a crash I don't know, Avon never tested these.  This car desk has all the little pouches and pockets and space needed, comes with a dry erase eraser, and I will be swapping out the dry erase marker it came with for a fully washable one I found at Walmart (they also have washable dry erase crayons).  I also feel that when open it is sturdily held at a 90 degree angle, something else that I had read as a complaint about the Alex Car Valet.  Now, I took one of my daughters out to the truck right away to try it on for size as there were a lot of complaints about the Alex Car Valet not reaching kids' laps.  With as close as things are in our truck (Tacoma) I did not think this was going to be a problem and it wasn't.  However, it had to be strung up quite high and the strap did not get short enough to keep it high enough, that is something I think I can take care of by stitching the strap myself to the length we need.  One complaint I do have is that it only comes with one strap, there is nothing to keep the unit strapped down at the bottom, it just hangs from the top.  At least this is around the bars of the head rest and the straps don't touch the person in the seat, I had read that the straps on the Alex Car Valet can be uncomfortable for the person in the seat they are strapped to.  A second complaint is the lack of instructions, it had a small advisory about the dry erase marker and a thing about the light and its batteries and all, but nothing about how to hang on the seatback, I mean what if I am doing it wrong and that's why the strap is too long?  The straps sure look different in the picture than when I try to hang it.  Now, would I buy this again?  Yes, as long as I was buying it for the same as or cheaper than the Alex Car Valet (which I found as cheap as $13 before shipping).  That said, since I have twins and need another one of these, if I do not find another Avon Light and Write Car Organizer in time for our big road trip at a decent price, then I will buy an Alex Car Valet and hope the twins don't fight over who gets the more colorful car desk :)Addendum, the larger of our twins is a pound away from being able to use a butt booster, we purchased one for her though are not using it yet, and I tried this car desk with her in the booster and it does not reach her because the booster has her sitting back farther than the 5 pt. harness car seat.  Also, Avon has released new travel desks, they are licensed characters form Nickelodeon and Disney, and the are the same except that they only have one large mesh pocket and do not come with the light, the sell for $13 right now directly from Avon.",4

"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue","We don't go anywhere without it.It was worth every penny. Now, if only my toddler used it ALL the time...",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,This is a great product if you make large amounts of formula It saved my arm from having to shake lots of bottles each day and makes a whole day's worth of bottles in one go. I have loved this for both of my daughters.,5
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I purchased the Fuzzibunz one size elite along with several other pocket diapers to try on my daughter.  Compared to other pocket diapers, the Fuzzinbunz diaper is much trimmer, which I like a lot.  I also like that I have not had any leaks with this diaper. However, the pocket is very narrow and the PUL is quite sticky, making it more difficult to stuff than any of my other diapers.  I also do not like love the way the diaper adjusts (elastic); it has been difficult to get a good fit.  Overall, this is a good diaper, but at this price point, I prefer other diapers.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have both the Mocha Turtle, and Ladybug Cloud B night lights, one for each of my daughters - one is 9 years and one is  9 months and they both use them every night!The thing I love most about them (other than how cute they are!) is how long the lights stay on. Both girls are asleep by the time they switch off. They are not too bright but the room is filled with a nice glow from all the stars all over the ceiling/wall.The Turtle glows blue, yellow and green and has an option to cycle through the colours automatically. The Ladybug does NOT have this option and I didn't realise it at the time, and was a little disappointed to find out, though it's more my fault for not reading carefully. Ladybug can glow red, blue or green.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the batteries (3 x AAA) don't last as long as I'd like before the lights start getting dim. The turtle will stay yellow and just flash instead of cycling when the batteries start getting low. The ladybug seems to run the batteries down slightly faster than the turtle, not sure why.Overall though, I do love them and would recommend these beautiful nightlights. I actually want to get another one for myself :)",4
"Munchkin Shampoo Rinser, Colors May Vary",The flexible material allows the mouth of the mug to mold around my son's head allowing the water to flow away from his face! It is light weight and durable. We love it!,5
"Frenchie Mini Couture Tuxedo Bib with 3D Applique, Black","Once you get this bib all you need is a monocle and a nice pipe and you could be the star of the baby celebration ball for something baby related.  I bought it as a gift, I hope the refined taste is appreciated.",5
Munchkin See Baby Backseat Mirror,"it was really hard to find a mirror that worked well for the captain's chairs in my minivan, but this was the solution!  It's hard to tell in the pictures, but this mirror is basically made up of two parts- the base, which has two easily adjustable straps and clips to wrap around the headrest, one over the top/bottom and the other on the sides.  Then this base has the mirror on a stiff swivel that can be adjusted in a LARGE range of angles.  Very much worth the money, especially if you are using captains chairs in a minivan!  Oh, and this mirror doesn't distort the way others do, it's a very clear view of your baby!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix","Easy to use for both parents, easy to clean, easy to adjustable.We can dress baby with hot clothes without he is oppressed.",5
Bumgenius Freetime Cloth Diapers 6 Pack Mixed Colors Snaps,"These are some of the best cloth diapers I have tried. They are absorbable and light, and get more absorbable as you wash them. I have a long, thinner baby and they fit him very well. Really nice quality product. The absorbable material on the inside is made thicker with these flaps - look at some pics fo see what I mean - but these are crucial for drying in the sun or dryer in the same amount of time as other clothes. Othe brands of diapers need additional dry time, which is a huge pain. The only thing I would change is to make it tagless! I hate tags and cut them off. But super diaper, worth every penny.",5
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"We needed to transport 2 suitcases, a diaper bag, camera case, a stroller, 2 car seats, a 3 year old, and a 9 month old to/from airplane/car and with only 2 adults, I wasn't sure how we'd manage it.  I saw this and thought it would be perfect to strap one of the car seats onto the larger suitcase and have the 3 year old ride in it.  I read the reviews and saw someone said they just used a strap and got some other piece from the hardware store and did it themselves.  Being frugal, I figured I could do the same thing but couldn't quite envision what the other person was doing.  We ended up using a cargo strap and it worked out great!  My son loved riding in his seat through the airport and we managed to get everything to/from airplane/cars without an issue.I gave it 2 stars just for the idea.",2
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Snuggle Cub Soother Mobile,I bought this as a gift for my best friends new grandson. We both  really liked it. The quality was excellent.,5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,"I really like this mirror as it is in a swivel and allows for more positioning than a traditional mirror, but it does move easily if bumped.",4
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","This is the perfect size for my (98% tall) 2 1/2 year old. We have to watch the weight, but it stays on her shoulders well, and as she grows she'll be able to carry more. She can open the zippers easily and get things in and out by herself. It fits a coloring book and a surprising amount of stuff! I can see her using this for a number of years. Would definitely recommend!",5
"Tadpoles Damask Set of 2 Tab Top Curtain Panels, Black/White","I like these curtains, I do not have them in a nursery, they are in my kitchen... they match my kitchen towels and dish drying mats.",5
"Athena Nadia 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","We've had this for almost 3 years and have just re-assembled it for our second child. It has held up so well with our very active daughter. I've looked at and felt many different cribs and not found any in this price range that feel nearly as sturdy. Most seem to have thinner slats that feel plasticy and shake and wobble a lot. This is all wood and does not have that cheap, wobbly feel.",5
BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover - Single Pattern: Jungle,"I did a lot of research before I bought this product, reading reviews and such.  This cart cover is fantastic!  It has everything and well worth the price.  I love that I can just throw my wallet and keys in the zipper pocket and go.  I don't have to lug a purse or diaper bag.The BEST thing about this product is that it can be placed in the cart and removed all with one hand.  When you have a child in one arm that is essential.  The other cart covers with elastic all the way around require two hands.There are loops for connecting toys, places to hold snacks and a drink.  The thing I use the least is the pillow.  I used it all the time when she was an infant and I would lay her down in the cart.  Also used it to prop her up when she was first learning to sit up.  Otherwise, I don't use it anymore.My daughter is now 16 months and I still use it several times a week.  I also use it in restaurant highchairs, but it makes a tight fit.I would definitely recommend this product.  This is one of those MUST HAVE items that mom's pass on to each other.",5
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut",I found this while searching for Christmas presents for my 3 month old daughter. We call her Peanut so it seemed very fitting :-) I received it in record time and am so happy with it! No wonder it is moving up the Bestseller list! The doll inside the peanut is blue and is small enough for her to hold on to. She is starting to really grab and hold things and I'm sure she is going to love her first doll from Santa!,5
"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate",I love this sheet. It was exactly as it was described. I live in Maine so it will be great for those cold nights.,5
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,"Every parent should order this for their baby. This is also a great gift, it's simple and easy to use a lot of ppl don't think about it so is def something def",5
"Bummis Swimmi Cloth Diapers, Turtles, Small (9-15 lbs)","I really like that this swim diaper has velcro tabs on both sides. It is so easy to put on and take off and will keep any mess inside the diaper. Cute designs, too!",5
"Sesame Street Bath Gift Set (Hooded Towel, 2 Washclothes &amp; Terry Sponge)","Got this for a bath time theme gift for my nephew who loves Sesame Street. It's super cute and colorful, which he loves. It's a little bit on the thin side for a towel but it certainly gets the job done!",4
Dream On Me Potty Trainer Plus,Grandson has no problem sitting there. Entertaining while training. No fussing no crying no whining. Will go sit on his own.,5
"American Baby Company Jersey Knit Crib Sheet, Lavender",Haven't had this item long but we like it! The jersey knit is much cozier for baby than the typical cheap cotton sheet. I like it enough that when I somehow misplaced the first one I bought (gotta love baby brain) I ordered another!,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I never use my dishwasher (I hand wash everything), so this sterilizer was really convenient and practical for my pre-mature baby.  The only problem I had was that 1 of the bottles got partially melted, and that was on about the 10th use of the sterilizer.  I haven't had any other difficulties since then, and that's even with laying my Dr. Brown's long & skinny bottles on their sides (I don't sterilize the inner tubing though, just in case).",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","First two weeks I held the bottles and it was not fun. My arms got tried along with a waste of time. After getting this product I could check emails, attend to more baby demands with free hands,  play a game on my cell phone (a few minutes of mommy time to help my sanity) and just relax better.",5
Baby Jogger 2013 City Select Stroller with Second Seat - Onyx,"I absolutely love this stroller! I originally purchased the phil and ted double stroller. It was great as a single, but as soon as I had my 2nd baby I hated it due to lack of storage space, popped 2 tires in 2 months and my daughter hated sitting in the back seat. So then I found this stroller and wished I had got it in the first place.My favorite things about it is the variety of seat configurations, great storage space, narrow profile so it is perfect for taking to the mall. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it is pretty heavy, but I think all high quality double strollers are heavy.",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","This item was recommended by many so I purchased it for our little one.  The only complaint I would have is that it looks very dirty in real life, it's not a white or even an off white.  It looks a lot darker than it does in pictures.",5
"Dabbawalla Lunch Bag, Cute as a Bug",I needed something to throw into the washer and this can handle it. Great colors and my son lives it.,5
Kolcraft Tender Vibes Travel Bassinet with Music,This is absolutely worth the price. The wheels went on with no troubles at all. It is very sturdy and the padding is thin but definitely thick enough for an infant. I wouldn't bother replacing the padding because it is fine. It looks gorgeous and is a great size and height. I wouldn't waste any money on something that costs more. Great product for a fantastic price!,5
Replacement Battery For Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor TFL AAA Model MBP33 MBP36 MBP36PU Part TFL3X44AAA900 CB94-01A 3.6V NiMH,"product is definitely not specifically designed for the Motorola MBP-36 as claimed.  It's a generic universal charger with an adapter plug.  The pins on the adapter I received were bent and barely fit the cord.  It charges the unit, but only when you jiggle the cord and get the connection to sit at just the right angle.For the price, it's OK...but you get what you pay for.",3
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I received this bag as a baby shower gift and really liked it.  The style was great, loved the design... but it's very poorly made.  After carrying it the FIRST time the inside liner started ripping.  I ended up returning it and ordering a Timi & Leslie one which I love!",2
My First Christmas Photo Album,This is the perfect photo album for my newborn son. The photos slide in easily and stay put without being obnoxiously stubborn to get out if you want to rearrange the photos. [...]you won't be disappointed when this is delivered...a great product and very cute.,5
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow, Enchanting Elephants","Excellent for grandparents/babysitters!This is a wonderful, if not necessary purchase for anyone who cares for an infant, whether nursing or not. I got this pillow for my baby grandson to use when he visits. It's adorable, well-made, soft but supportive, and versatile.I use it for comfort and support while bottle feeding him, and it makes his tummy time more comfortable, as he has an easier time looking around.  It's also been great for propping the little guy up while I'm tasking;  he's content and relaxed in it. We've used the vibrational feature and it seems to soothe him, but he's otherwise happy without it so far.I feel this is a must-have for anyone with a little one in their home! Highly recommended!",5
Baby Girl Necessities Photo Mat 11 x 14,"I just received the baby girl necessities photo mat in 3D and just love it.  In addition, I ordered 2 school years scrap a mat school days mats and I loved them too.  The 3D mat is really done up so beautifully with the little 3D dress and other items and I am giving this to my daughter in law as part of a baby shower gift.  I know she will love it, too.I am so completely satisfied with Bellas Dream Photo Mats.  It's fun just looking at all of the mat designs and colors they have. I have dealt with them on a replacement issue and they have exceeded my expectations in how it was handled.  I highly recommend them if you need to either give a unique gift to someone or just want to have a quality product for your own child or children.  Definitely will purchase from Bellas in the future.",5
"Wupzey Shopping Cart Cover, Orange Stripe","Very well made.  We used it everywhere we went.  Easy to install, washes easy, and covered all areas our daughter would try to touch on the cart.  We received many compliments for it and we were asked many times where do you buy one of these at.  A must have unless you like cleaning a shopping cart before you place your child in it.",5
"Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone, Neutral","I have been very happy with this toy considering it is about half the price of other activity centers. I chose this one because I live in a small apt and wanted something that could be moved easily through doorways and fit into my tiny bathroom.  It doesn't have as many toys on it as some of the other centers, but you get what you pay for, I figure.  The toys it does have are fun and sturdy.We got it when my daughter was 9 months old, and then she would play in it happily for 20 minutes.  Now, at a year old, she is ready to get out after 10, but I guess that is to be expected.  I only put her in it about twice a week at the most now.  But she pulls up on it and likes to crawl through it, so she is still having fun with it in her own way.I will confirm what other reviewers have said -- this absolutely does NOT bounce! It does not have springs in the seat like an Exersaucer.  I guess maybe if my daughter jumped really, really hard, she might be able to make the platform bounce a tiny bit, but I haven't wanted to encourage that.If you have more space and more money, I would suggest an Exersaucer instead. You would probably get more mileage out of it. (Our church has one, and my daughter does seem to enjoy it more.)  But if you are on a tight budget and/or living in a tight space, this is a good deal.",4
Kel - Gar Tubbly - Bubbly Hippo,This keep my baby from hitting his head on the water spout in the tub. My only complaint is that it comes off way too easily... he can pull it off by himself so I try to keep him away from it as much as possible.,4
"Tinkerbell Costume for Toddler Tinkerbelle Birthday Party and Dress Up, Green, Small 1T-2T","Great gift for my 2 year old daughter this year.  Wings are very sturdy and nice quality, the skirt was made well too.",5
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"I was very impressed when I received the play tray in the mail as it was much heavier, very sturdy and thicker then I antcipated.I have the original Tripp Trapp high chair with the European style infant seat attached and it fit perfectly over the infant insert.  This play tray also has a rectangular metal bar attched underneath and comes with a black strap so you can anchor the play tray to the high chair without the infant seat attched and the strap will go between the childs leggs to keep them from sliding out.I have been using my play tray for a month now with my 9 month old in the infant insert and love it.  I can let him make a mess while eating the simply slide the play tray off and throw the food in the bin and wash the tray properly and slide it back on.For more information this is the website of the company that makes the play tray:[....]",5
"Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap, 6 Ounce","This is the one registry item that I wouldn't buy again nor recommend to others.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing innately wrong with this soap, I just feel that it was a rather useless item and that your money is better spent on the 5,000 other baby things that you need to buy.",2
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White","This mattress is lightweight, durable, and waterproof.  My daughter sleeps 12 plus hours a night on this mattress, and after nearly 2 years of use it still looks brand new!  I will be buying another one for my next child.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren't so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I'd try them.  Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days.  It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system.  On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed!  It was ridiculous.  A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days.  Don't waste your money.  I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown's bottles.  They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them.",1
Fisher-Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"When our swing arrived I was actually kind of disappointed since it didn't seem to swing at all even on the highest  setting. I called Fisher Price to complaint about it and they told me to change the batteries since that was the most common reason for the swings not working properly. I did, and nothing seemed to change. So I called them again wanting to return the product, they told me that they would send me a new motor part in order to fix the problem. I was very skeptical, but when the part arrived (next day, bravo Fisher Price!) and I replaced it, it started to work wonderfully, maybe even a little too fast for my newborn, but he seemed to like it.Every time we need a moment for ourselves we know the swing will work his magic. Hey, sometimes he enjoys it even without the swinging motion, so it's a convenience that I can transport the little chair to spots the whole swing couldn't fit.At the beginning I thought the two little toys that came with it were too small, but our son seems to love them and he's starting to coo and giggle at them (or yelling at them as well, don't ask..)I also love the idea of being able to keep the rocking chair once our son gets too big for the swing.All in all, great and versatile product (specially for the price), and a great experience with Fisher Price's customer service.",5
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"As described easy to use and holds a good amount of wipes, slight bigger than usual wipes cases but very well made. Recommend this product.",4
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"Three children under five have made full use of The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat feeding chair.  It's really, really practical.  It tilts back for babies (NOT newborns - about 12 weeks and up, give or take variations in head control) and works great as a comfortable booster seat at the table for toddlers and preschoolers.The three-year-old would never finish a meal if he wasn't seated in the feeding chair but because of the sides he can settle down and eat.  In a regular chair or ordinary booster seat he can't resist getting down :).The cover washes up well - I put it in the dryer about five minutes and then let it air dry.  The straps can be removed and washed with liquid dish detergent.  The tray goes through the dishwasher if you like.This feeding seat worked so well I bought a second one to accommodate the latest addition while her big brother continues to use the original.",5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","I registered for these bottles while I was pregnant based on reviews I had read and hear-say from people I'd meet in the store while ""researching"" them. Of course when you are a first time mom you aren't familiar with any of the baby stuff so you have to take advice on these sorts of things from other moms. I think the concept of these bottles is wonderful but they are too aggravating. I never used one of these bottles that didn't leak. No matter what I did to try to get them not to leak, it didn't work. So they made for a very messy feeding time and a waste of milk; and as a first time mom with a newborn, this is the last thing I wanted to deal with! I always had to make sure that my daughter had a bib on or I had a burp cloth tucked under her chin. I have recently switched to the Playtex VentAire and feeding time is much more enjoyable and not messy at all!",2
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"This mobile works wonderfully. Our child is fascinated with it and it keeps him engaged for a reasonable amount of time. However, the plastic feels cheap and flimsy. It's quite frustrating to swap the cards on the mobile as well as flipping them.",4
Portacrib 2 Pack Value Jersey White Fitted Sheet by American Baby Company,I bought a small portable crib for my new grandbabies and the sheets fit it beautifully. They are made so that you can use a thicker mattress with them which is awesome because I did buy a thicker mattress as the one most port-a-cribs come with our horrible and thin. The sheets washed great and still look good and love the softness as I don't want anything rough against my grandbabies skin!,5
Fisher-Price Sing with Me Step Stool,My grandson is new at the potty game. He uses the stool for using the pottty and @ the sink to brush his teeth. He loves the music.,5

"Safety 1st Nature Next Booster Seat, Green","Other reviews were right on.  Product was sturdy and price was good, but the straps were right in the middle of the seat and the lower strap was too short to get around my 20-month old in cloth diapers.  I thought maybe I could just use the side straps to buckle him in but those need to buckle into the  middle one.",3
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","We just love the Skip Hop zoo lunch bags. The elephant is very cute and just the right size for our 2 yr old and our 4 1/2 yr old. A sandwich, drink and fruit/yogurt fit well inside; there is a mesh pouch on the inside flap that is great for holding utensils and napkins.  The lunch bag is well insulated. We place an ice pack or cold drink in the bag and it keeps food fresh for several hours.",5
Kidsline Barnyard Wallpaper Border,"I saw this at my local Babies R Us store and had to get it. The border goes really well with the yellow I painted the nursery, and was easy to put on myself (even though I am 7 months pregnant). The only thing I didn't like was that the instructions said soak in warm water for 10 seconds to activate the adhesive which did not work on the first piece I did. It kept falling off. Finally, I switched to hot water soaking for 15 seconds and it went smoother.",4
"Boppy SlideLine Toy Slipcover, Animal Playground",Great color and softness. Love it,5
Travel Potty Chair,"My newly trained 2 year old tends to say she has to potty after we are ten minutes down the road. So, having this in the car has been a lifesaver! My daughter can go in the car, on the side of the road in a discreet side of the car, or just when she needs to go and we are at the park.  BEST BUY EVER! (in my opinion!)  I like that you can use gallon size bags and I especially like the storage on either side for wipes and extra baggies. I tell every mom I know who has a potty trained toddler! It is the best potty seat I could have ever bought!",5
"green sprouts Warming Plate, Sage",it is very good .I want buy it long long ago.It could keep my child's food warming.it is beautiful.I like it,5
InfinityMOM Nursing Scarf (Coral Chevron),"Cute scarf and an ok alternative to those bulky covers, but I quickly realized I'm one of those moms who feels no shame about openly feeding in public when it's necessary and my mini me hates being covered up. She always ripped off covers anyway, so I gave up and just use this as a scarf now.The couple times I did use it, I found it a little difficult. It falls in baby's face and then I understood why the ugly bulky covers are bulky.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair,I love that my daughter can sit and play while I cook dinner and she can watch me the whole time. It is easy to move around and it is so easy to clean.,5
Sassy Extra Gentle Soft Tip Spoons 4 Pack,These are not BPA free which I didnt even realize until after I purchased... I would not recommend these!,1
Vulli Sophie Giraffe So Pure Sophie the Giraffe Teething Ring Key Chain,This product is ok I thought my daughter would chew on it as she chews on my keys all the time.  Not interested.  Also it fails that safety test of if it can fit through a toilet paper roll they can swallow - she can swallow it.  Also it does not come off key ring so its another key ring on my keys!,2
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We bought the  Diaper Dekor Plus based on what I read in &quot;Baby Bargains&quot; and the recommendations on this web site.  We love the functionality, it is very easy to use and empty, but it makes the whole room stink!  You can even smell it from the hallway.  My son is only 6 weeks old, I can't imagine what it would smell like with older kids diapers.  We have now purchased the new Safety 1st Neat pail...hope it is better.",2
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Good fit on changing table. The sides prevent baby from rolling over on the changing table, however never walk away while baby is on the table. It is easy to clean and rinse off since it is made of plastic.",5
Bedtime Originals Champ Snoopy 3 Piece Crib Bedding Set,Purchased for my son who is due in March. I haven't set it up yet until a week before baby is born but It seems to be of good quality for the price! I loved the snoopy designs...,5
"Keekaroo High Chair and Infant Insert Tray, Chocolate","We've had this chair for about 3 months & are very pleased with our choice.  I did tons of research before settling on the Keekaroo & have no regrets about my choice.  First and foremost, the fact that it was a wood chair & not a plastic monstrosity in my kitchen is huge.  It blends in well with the decor (although I'm a little disappointed that I didn't wait for the darker finish) & doesn't stick out like a huge sore thumb.  It is fairly easy to clean & doesn't have too many nooks & crannies for messes to hide.  I'm pleased with my decision to purchase the infant insert because even my 9-month old gets pretty squirmy & it keeps her firmly in her place at mealtime.As others have mentioned, I wish there was a plastic cover to protect the tray, but I've heard that is coming & I'll definitely buy one when I see it.  Although I have to say, our tray surface looks perfectly fine after 3+ months of use.  Although our little one is still fed by us & isn't banging silverware or toys on the surface.Compared to many of the others on the market, the price is great for the style of chair.  I read one negative comment about not being able to release the tray with one hand.  We found that we keep the tray inserted upside down so it doesn't lock in when we're not using it.  That way when we're holding baby & wanting to put her in the chair, we can easily pull the tray out & put her in with one hand.  Then we simply flip the tray right side up and lock it in place.",5

"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti","We LOVE this seat! As parents to 8 children ranging in age from 18 down to 22 months we have some pretty good car-seat experience. We have purchased and used other brands of car-seats thru the years and just now decided to try a Britax after reading countless wonderful reviews on their quality and top of the line safety features. Well, let's just say it is quite obvious to us now that you do truly get what you pay for in terms of quality. This seat is OUTSTANDING in quality materials and workmanship. There is just tons of padding in the seat to make it extra comfortable for your child and all the features are built in a way to ensure the utmost comfort for the child sitting in the seat. We love how easy it was to install this seat- less than 2 minutes and we were ready to go! Latch is a breeze- adjusting the harness height is simple. The new HUGS harness system takes a few extra minutes to get use to and to be able to adjust easily. We had no trouble figuring it out. You simply pull on the actual chest clip piece while using the other hand (finger) to push on the little harness button release lever in the front of the seat under the padding (there is a little opening in the fabric where you stick your finger in to access the release lever). We have no issues at this point with feeling the straps are too short or anything...they are plenty long enough when you loosen them the correct way. If you just try to pull on the straps to loosen them you will only be able to pull them out a little bit due to the new HUGS tethering system. Our son is 22 months old and weighs 26 lbs and is 34"" tall. He has a long torso and shorter legs. He has plenty of room to grow with this seat and stay rear-facing for at least another year or more depending on how fast he grows. We plan to keep him rear-facing till at least age 3- 3.5, as close to age 4 as possible. This is the safest thing for all toddlers and babies! Protects their delicate necks in the event of a collision. He has plenty of leg room and loves to sit with his legs up on the seat back or crossed in  the seat. He is perfectly comfortable in this very plush seat. We got the cowmooflage seat  and is a very nice print! Not at all dingy looking as in the pictures on here...the black and white on the seat are very bright! My husband feels this seat is WAYYYY more sturdy and safer feeling compared to other seats on the market. He is a fireman so I trust his opinion! :-) We really love this seat and are so glad we picked this one! We decided on this one over the Marathon due to the click and safe feature and also the extra side impact protection headwings. Glad we did!! GREAT seat and worth every penny!!!",5
900 MHz Home Connection Monitor,"After not having any luck finding another monitor that would be compatible with the one I already had, I bought this one to monitor my infant,toddler and play rooms. It worked fantastic for the first 5 hours and then one reciever played static on all 3 rooms after I turned it off and back on again. The other receiver still worked, but why pay $130 and have part of it not work?  I tried all of the trouble shooting tips and this was not even mentioned. Also every 5 minutes or so, we would get a loud screech from one of the monitors. This probably because of too many other devices in our house and neighborhood that use 900 mhz and interfere. Our other one works great and uses only 49 mhz. I don't have the time or patience to call the Safety 1st customer service who will probably say to ship it back to the manufacturer to fix the 1 reciever. It's going back to the store not even 24 hours after buying it.  We are going to try one with more than 2 channels next to see if that solves the static problem.  But as far as one reciever not working at all, that is unacceptable.",1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","Easy to assemble and adjust straps.  Trouble free setup in no time.  Easy to clean.  Nice, big tray.  Sturdy and attractive product.  Fits my 17 month old niece well.  Very convenient for babysitting duties.  With 8 chairs around the dining table, we didn't need to add a standard high chair.  Should have bought this sooner!",5

Munchkin Light My Way Nightlight,"We bought this night light when our 2-year-old started taking apart the regular table lamp in her room. So, first on the list was something child-proof -- check!  Batteries are accessible only by taking out the tiny screws in the lid on the bottom. Unless she somehow learns to correctly use a small screwdriver (ha!), there is no way she is taking this apart. Good.This runs on 3 AAA batteries, and after 8 months of using it every single day, it is still going on the original set. Even if I had to replace them by now, I would say it is very worth it because the light can be put anywhere. In the bed, on the bed shelf, on the dresser...it moves around a lot. Camping? No problem! Just bring it and it's another comfort of home right there with us. Plus, I used it myself to see in the tent without waking her up! It's also very easy to pack when we stay at someone else's house. Same reasons as camping. This is why I can honestly say we use it every single day.Other things I like:--It is durable. Little girl has hardwood floors in her room, and the owl has had its fair share of falls. But there are no cracks and it still works just fine. Some of the paint on the eyes/beak has rubbed off, but we don't mind.--The automatic shut off.  I love it. I wish more lights had this. Saves battery life, and one less thing for me to worry about. 20 minutes has been a good time, too, and if my girl is still awake, she easily turns it back on for another 20.--LED light means it does not get too warm...safe to snuggle with, even under blankets.--The handle is perfect for her (or me) to carry it around easily.--It is just plain cute! And my little girl loved it right from the start because of that.The actual light it gives is white and brighter than most night lights, but not as bright as a regular lamp. This is a positive/negative thing for me. I like that the light is nice and mellow and not so bright that it is distracting. But my little girl recently likes to look at her books in bed, and this light just isn't quite bright enough for that, unless it's extremely close to the page, which is hard for a toddler to manage while lying down. She just can't look at books with this light.So, I am looking for something brighter now, and she will probably end up using both. Maybe we can try another plug-in lamp now that she is getting older. I still give this 5 stars though, because it has been so good during this time -- it has been a daily must-have item, along with her pillow and special blanket. And it is not even very expensive, in my opinion, considering the use it has had. If I could find one exactly like this but brighter (and similarly well priced), I would buy it in a second.",5
Phil and Teds Dash Buggy With Doubles Kit Black,"We did a TON of research before buying a double stroller and after 2 months of online reviews and test driving strollers in-store we purchased the P&T; Dash Buggy Double in Black.When it arrived, I found not only did I have to assemble most of it, I was shocked to open the box and find that 3 things were broken or wrong with it.One of the plastic pieces used to connect the canopy to the stroller had snapped off, one of the black loops on the side of the seat was ripped and the front wheel well had the metal completely scratched off! I was disappointed and a little leery of exchanging it for a new one. If these pieces broke that easy in shipping how sturdy could it be and we spent $500 on this stroller!I returned it and even though I wanted a tandem double with a small footprint we ended up with the BOB Revolution Duallie. I must say we ended up getting it on sale for $454.99 (almost $50 less than the P&T;) and not only was it LESS than the Dash, but the quality is 100% better, it came assembled and even though it is much wider than the P&T; it is easier to maneuver.Hope this helps make someone else's decision easier!",2
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","Love these!  This is the only thing that my two and a half year old can't get through!  That being said, I have had to replace them a few times. They are plastic and if you drop them or slam the door and hit the piece just right, they will break. For the money and considering how expensive and completely ineffective everything else I have bought has been, I think these are great. One other thing to note - these will scratch your door jam slightly and you can't ever completely close the door when these are on - not a big deal though because it takes a second to take them off and put them back on.  To me, the most important thing is keeping my son safe so the good definitely outweighs any negatives about this product.",5
"Sassy No Scratch Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary","The very first time I used this product was my last. We have small mouth bottles and I thought this would do the trick to wash them. I liked how the nipple brush was designed so it could not be lost but it never made it that far. It was inserted into the first bottle for washing, the silicone head got stuck inside and when I tried to pull it out it ripped away from the brush leaving the silicone brush inside the bottle. With no way to re-attach it both pieces went straight to the trash can. What a waste!",1

"DaVinci Porter 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry",I love the way this crib looks! My only complaint is that it seems to scratch and mark up very easily so teething protectors are a must have also the stickers all over it leave a horrible residue. But it seems to be durable enough to hold up to the years of use I expect to get out of it!,4
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","I use these bibs because you only need like 2-3 of them. They are easy to clean and dries fast - which is the most important factor for me. Unlike cloth ones, these don't stain and looks new after many, many uses.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"Great present for my grandson, he loved it so much with the sea on the ceiling and soothing ocean waves.

"Mobi Technologies Dualscan Ultra Thermometer, White/Blue","After reading mixed reviews I decided to try it myself because reviews can often be wrong one way or the other and there was an equal amount of good and bad. This thermometer was not accurate at all. The buttons really sucked so it was hard to get the thermometer to do what you wanted to do, they stuck and were hard to push. The flashlight did not work at all. Luckily it's a baby item so there's a 90 day return policy and I returned it.",1

Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"Baby is now 7 mos old and continues to love this activity center.  We got it when he was 6 mos old and he was a little short even on the lowest height setting.  We had a 2 inch piece of foam and put it under his feet and he was so happy to practice standing and play with primarily the sun-face.  Now 1 month later he doesn't need the foam to stand up and touch the bottom.  He also stands in it for a long time squealing and laughing while spinning the circles and hitting the barnyard animal noise maker.  Love it, love it, love it.  He also can turn the seat 360 now to follow anyone who enters the room.",5

"Kissa's Wool Lover Diaper Cover, Natural, Small","I love this cover. I'd be excited to buy more but can't justify the price since I usually make my own.  It so soft and lovely. Good stretch. I will say that it's smaller than I expected. I had ordered it for Christmas but I was worried that the use I'd get from it would be severely limited by then. Maybe it'll grow with him more than that. I guess we'll see. I'm pretty happy using it right now anyway :). Very trim. My baby had a blowout in it (as in, it came out of his prefold, not the cover) and I was worried that it would be stained for good. I washed and washed and washed it and it didnt budge. But, putting it out in the sun to dry, the stain was 100% gone before it was even dry. Looked brand new. Very happy.",5
"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Grey","The construction seem poor on the foundation. I use it about once a week for my grandson so it's okay, but if I had to use this for my 5 kids everyday when they were small, then I'd pass and purchase a better quality.

Lansinoh TheraPearl 3-in-1 Breast Therapy,"Was looking forward to using these once they arrived after reading a few reviews. First, I only used it for &#34;hot therapy&#34;. When I used it you have to throw them into these little sacks and keep them there so that it doesn't burn you. Well, the material might be too thick because you can't feel the heat once their in their little sack. I did use them for a few weeks (I'd say about 5-6 weeks) before they started to crack. I started finding the little pebbles on the floor. They're ok, but not the best.",2
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Just received the stroller today and right when I opened the box I noticed the color.  The person that named this stroller color ""red stripe"" must be color blind.  This stroller is burgundy!  It is no were near ""red."" It's Aggie burgundy! Being a Longhorn fan, I am very disappointed!  Other than the color, I like the stroller but I agree with some of the other reviews on wishing the visor was adjustable.  I'm going to look into exchanging it for a different color.",4

Cotton Tale Designs Arctic Babies Musical Mobile,"I bought this to go along with the rest of the set and it is absolutely adorable! It is also very easy to set up. However, the first time I turned it on, it was so loud and has no volume control. It did not help my baby sleep it scared him. After trying it a few times he got use to the volume and does like it now. The loudness helps distract him from being upset and he falls asleep better (assuming this is why it is so loud.) The thing that really disappointed me is after using the mobile for about three weeks it started messing up, notes keep cutting out. You can't really tell what song it is trying to play now, it sounds like a cell phone with bad reception. We have only used it for two months and at this rate by four months it won't play any music at all. At least it will look pretty.",2
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",I hate the thought of putting my baby's bottles and items on the same dish rack we use.

I bought a second one to give to a friend because I liked it that much.,5

Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"Lamaze makes a very high quality soft toy.  Like the others my grandson has been given, the Clutch Cube Baby Toy is very well made.  The seams are securely sewn.  The different fabrics offer differing tactile experiences to stimulate baby's sense of touch.  The bright colors are visually stimulating.  The hard rings are wonderful for gumming when baby's teeth are coming in.  The hidden panel which opens to reveal a mirror provides the element of surprise to entertain baby.My only criticism is that this cube is rather large and is hard for younger infants to handle.  I question whether older infants who are large enough to handle this toy will find it interesting.  For a six month old who is very interested, this toy is just too large to handle and Grandma ends up manipulating it to entertain baby.",4

Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,The one drawback with this item is that you need 2 people.  Maybe when my daughters head grows we won't need 2 people but right now my husband has to put it on her head and put a little bit of pressure on the side so that no water goes onto her face or ears. But I still think its great when there is no crying when washing hair and it only takes about 15 seconds with a plastic cup to rinse and she's done.,4
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","Nice picture, clear tunes, good range, easy setup. I am quite impressed with this item. To be honest I have only tested it with my wife because our son isn't here yet, but it works perfectly right now.",5

My grandsons looks great in there suits for church.",5

I'm not impressed. The last 3 orders from amazon have not been correct and there vendors they go through are going to make me chose other online shopping sites very soon. Hopefully these people are better than my last two purchases where the vendor that sold the item hung up on me multiple times even though I was being patient and polite. I just gave up on the last two orders. This one I hope I can get it switched for the CORRECT item. Haven't taken it out of the packaging but this error deserves a one star.

"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I have to say that I'm surprised that I'm so pleased with this crib that I am actually taking the time (with 3 kids) to write a review.  My previous cribs have been more ""high dollar"" from Pottery Barn and I have been pleased with theirs as well, but this crib is really every bit as good and much easier to assemble.  Assembly took only about 20 minutes, the finish is really nice and the crib itself is really sturdy.  I also appreciate the fact that they didn't put the warning label stickers all over the visible area of the crib, which is what I experienced with my last Pottery Barn crib.  I truly could not be happier with this purchase-- don't let the low price fool you!",5
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots","I got this an extra seat so my daughter could ride in our second car without us having to move the Britax Marathon, which can be kind of a pain. She's tall enough for it and just meets the weight requirement. She seems to fit in it well. When my son needed a booster a few years ago, the Britax models were too narrow for him. My daughter is slender compared to him and I think that is why this seat is a good fit for her.It was simple to assemble by sliding the back on the base and snapping it in place. It is lightweight and easy to put in the car. The padding is comfortable and the pattern is very nice. It has two arm rests, but they are short and a bit too low for my daughter to use. She does really like the cup holders. There is one on each side, so if you have a car seat next to this booster and it blocks the holder on that side, you can use the other. They are difficult for my daughter to pull out though if she is already seated; she pulls them out before climbing in. Her other complaint is that the slide guard bothers her legs. It is an inverted V and the straps press or rub against her thighs, particularly if she's wearing shorts. I think it is a nice safety feature to have though and I don't mind putting up with a few of her comments.It's designed for her to use with or without the back for a long time, so I'm sure we will get a lot of use out of this seat. Overall, it does the job and I am very pleased.",4
Ellie &amp; Luke (Brown) Diaper Bag with Changing Pad 6 Pieces Set,i brought this bag and am very please with it i would recommend it to any mother  who is looking for a baby bag to buy,5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Giggables - Elephant,"These toys are cute. And even though I could have found one at a specific retail store (they retail for $5.99) for half the price of what Amazon charges, I bit the bullet and bought one from Amazon.com anyway. When it got to the house, it sounded like a dying cat. It had been turned on before it was shipped and that poor elephant had giggled all the way from Amazon's warehouse to my doorstep. As you can imagine, it was pretty tired of giggling and the batteries completely died in the living room. So, not only did I spend $10 too much to BUY this toy, but now, I have to buy new batteries for it (and not cheap batteries either...those little round disc batteries!). I will be returning this toy to Amazon.com and I will be going to the retail store like I should have in the first place.I suppose that's more of a review on Amazon's poor skills though.The toy itself is cute. It's about the size of a tennis ball and makes goofy sounds when rolled across the floor. I thought that these made the respective animal sound when rolled, but they do not (at least the elephant does not). There is a little on/off button on the side which I think will prove dangerous for the toy if my drooly boy gets ahold of it and slobbers all over it. Other than that, it's worth the $6 you would pay for it in the retail store, but NOT worth the $15 that Amazon.com is charging, in my honest opinion.*****UPDATE*****After looking over the packaging again, I found that the batteries are not replaceable. I'm not sure what made me think they took watch batteries. Stress, maybe? So, now I have a dead elephant in my house. This is definitely being returned to Amazon! I still think this would make a great toy for young kids, but I'm decreasing my rating for durability. The toy is durable enough for those that like to throw things and are hard on toys, but batteries that aren't replaceable make it a toy that won't be played with after the batteries die and I'm not sure how long they actually last. Mine didn't make it more than the two day shipping period.",2
"Bumbleride Travel Bag for Flite, Black",Fits the flite perfectly and if you're going to spend that kind of money on an umbrella stroller it's worth getting this to protect your investment.  It's padded on the inside and is easy to carry with the straps.  I took this on a flight to Los Angeles from Tokyo roundtrip and my Bumbleride flight came back in perfect condition!  Not a scratch or dent which is amazing because I couldn't gate check this so I had to baggage claim it.  I highly recommend this if you are traveling by air.  I also like the idea that I'll have this to store my stroller until the next little one comes around.,5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I had the Baby Bjorn and the Moby wrap. Hands down this is way easier to use. My husband likes to wear him as well. I use it only for short periods of time while shopping. I was concerned about it hurting my back and the babies hips. So far there have been no issues but we don't use it for extended periods of time.Right now my little guy is 6 months old and about 18 lbs. We have only used it facing inwards but I am going to turn him outwards next time we are out. I do think it's difficult to bend over to pick things up. I'm always worried he will hit his head so you have to be cautious of that.,5
"Tommee Tippee Bottle, 9 Ounce, 3 Count","I have a breastfed baby who has also been taking bottles from very early on but has always stopped a lot to burp or fuss while taking bottles (particularly the Dr. Brown's).  I tried these out on a lark and she LOVES THEM.  Doesn't stop at all the whole bottle.  She does leak some around her face because she's eating so intensely, but I'm ok with that because she really really likes the bottles and has been very happy.  After fighting with the Dr. Browns for months and finding they made her MORE gassy because she didn't latch onto them well and swallowed a lot of air, I'm so happy to find these.  I'll take a messy face over an unhappy baby who has to stop 3-4 a bottle to burp that we had with Dr. Brown's.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I don't have too much to say about these...it's just a spoon, afterall.  I'll just say that my 7 month old doesn't care for this spoon.  She prefers the Gerber baby spoons.  I think it's because they are more shallow then these deeper spoons.",3
"MAM Trends Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2-Count","Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn/infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing. A must for new babies!",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Video Camera,"We liked this product until after 7 months, the picture on the monitor would go black or green lines and the sound would go out.  As far as we can tell, it is the camera side that is bad, not the parent unit.  It was a gift and so we don't have a receipt.  We are wondering if purchasing another camera is our best option?",3
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","I bought 2 of these for my girl twins and they love them.  The cuteness of the potties attracted them immediately and they rarely have accident using the froggy potty.  The potties are easy to take from room to room, empty and clean.  Overall, the froggy potty is a great value.",5
"Hook 'n' Stroll Stroller Accessory, Black","These have a lifesaver since the moment I attached them to my stroller! I have tested them holding groceries walking through my neighborhood, holding clothing at the mall, and holding all my bags on a trip to the park. They can hold a very surprising amount of weight, to the point where if I remove my kids the stroller tips backward and that shouldn't be possible being that it's a double stroller. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a need for two more hands :).",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This is the perfect travel size to drop in a purse and keep as a backup toy. My nephew loved it when he was younger, my sister would keep it hidden in her purse for when they were traveling, then bring it out for him if he started getting wound up. Since he didn't get it often it worked like a charm at the times she needed it to most!",4
"Diono RadianR120 Convertible Car Seat, Storm","WOW!  This car seat just seems to jump out from among the rest I looked at.  We were in need of something that would grow with our children.  This seat does that wonderfully as it will hold infants rear facing, older children forward facing and then changes into a booster seat.  Another hurdle for us was the fact that we drive a smaller Jeep Cherokee which does not have a lot of room in the back seat.  We needed two car seats and one booster seat to fit three across.  With the slightly narrower frame, the R120 fits wonderfully.  We laughed that there was the option for more than one cup holder but it is nice for our son to have his drink in one and snacks in another; or his favorite toys sitting close at hand.  The foldable feature came in handy when we recently had to fly across country.  I did not have to worry about it getting all beat up and banged up or the straps damaged because it folded up and protected itself.  Yes, this is a slightly more expensive car seat but you can not cheapen quality.  It is definitely worth every penny!",5
Evenflo Big Kid No Back Booster - Cobalt,My kids love the seat and cup holder. They also love putting things in the extra compartment. They sit secure and tell me its comfortable. No complaints so far.,5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,"This way one of the most helpful products in our potty training experience. It is not terribly sturdy, but if you put a bath mat under the legs, it helps. This really motivated my son to start potty training, so I suggest it. They can climb up easily and hold on to the sides. I recommend supervision.",4
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"I'm VERY surprised by this mei tai! My son is a month old and 10 1/2 lbs and it works awesome. I've had the k'tan and a sling and didn't like either. I LOVE this carrier. I wanted a babyhawk but couldn't afford it at the moment so got this based on all the great reviews, still nervous about it. I'm so glad I did. I feel secure enough to be hands free (don't with the k'tan as much). Baby loves it, he fell asleep within 5 minutes of being it it. He hates being put down so this will be a lifesaver. I'm not sure how this will be with an older child, it's a great concept so we'll see, but I may want something more supportive on my end (it's fine for them I feel). This is well worth the money and I highly recommend it. If you're baby hates being face in, this may not be for you. My son only wants to be face in, he hates if I cradle hold him of hold him on my side, so this is wonderful. If you are unsure about a mei tai, this is the perfect buy. It's convinced me to love them. It's super cute too! Babies r us has the other design. Enjoy!!!",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This baby monitor is a life saver. Had to spend so much else on baby stuff like the crib, pram, bottles, toys, didn't want to spend a few hundred more on a digital video monitor! I can tell exactly when my baby is crying with this machine, there is no fuzziness and very little lag, everything on the screen is very easy to distinguish! Love how both the brightness and volume are adjustable so that I can turn all the settings lower when it is night time and I am trying to sleep, and turn it up when I am up doing chores. Everything is very plastic like but it is still strong, managed to step over it quite heavily the other day when it was lying on the floor and it didn't come close to cracking! I bought this when it was on sale at $99.99 on amazon and the deals here on amazon are just getting better and better.",5
Tender CSR 2007 Stroller,"After searching through many doubles, I found this stroller.  Its wonderful.  It has a smooth ride, easy to steer (even with two kids loaded in, I can steer it with one hand).  The sunshades are awesome!!  You can unzip the backs of the sunshades for good air flow on hot days.  And if the infant falls asleep in his infant car seat, i can cover him completely out of the sun/weather.  Plus, it has an interesting adjustable handle.  My 6 ft hubby doesn't mind using it.  Cons:  if the car seat is in the stroller, my toddler in the front seat can't recline at all..not good if you have a hefty sized toddler.  Won't be a problem if you don't use the matching car seat.  The seats recline nicely, very easily.  Its a little annoying to keep it collapsed when I'm done with it - if you don't fold it up just right, the stroller won't stay closed - it pops open when I lift it in the car (my husband hates that part). Plus for the price, I'd expect a nice parent tray or cupholder - I don't even use the weak cupholder that came with it (it pops off easily and looks like the designer made it an afterthought - its really cheap looking).  And it has almost no storage - the little bit i have will be lost once the baby grows and uses the footrest.  Makes it hard to carry a purse/diaper bag, a drink and shopping bags.  I have considered buying the matching the diaper bag - it has hooks specifically for the diaperbag, but the bag is stiff looking - and masculine.  Overall though, it's an awesome stroller.  Fits in any place a single tandem would fit...Lighter than most doubles, fairly compact, easy to fold but has poor room for storage or cupholders.  I have a minivan and it can fit standing upwards, as well as on its side, or flat without a problem...I think it would fit in a larger trunk - like a Honda Accord sized trunk, but if you have a small car I doubt it would fit.",4
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant",I love the Bundle Me! It's makes going in the carseat and stroller so easy in cold weather. They are very plush and wash well. No bulky blankets and jackets. The toddler size is a little big with the infant carseats but worth it to continue on into toddler seats and strollers.,5
My Precious Baby Educational Bubbles,I bought these balls for my 1 year old son because he loves balls and I figured any educational balls would be a great addition.  I just wish they had the entire alphabet and number set. He loves throwing them around and then checking to see which side is facing up.,4
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","I'm not a toddler. Captain Obvious here! But I tried this out because I bring snacks with me to work everyday.I love the Dr. Seuss print. t's very colorful and just plain cute! I guess I just can't get the idea of using and reusing.I know this isn't the most ""green"" thing to say. But I just feel like $5 for one bag that you're constantly washing out,well I guess it's just not for me. But the quality is good. It withstood all the washings!",3
"OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green","I love OXO products so I was thrilled to find their baby/kids line. I despise babyish looking items in pinks with cartoon characters on them, so it was very refreshing to find this OXO snack cup in a gorgeous bright green with a modern look. Finally a snack cup that doesn't scream ""baby!"" The cup itself is extremely durable and has survived numerous falls. The lid always stays intact during the falls, ensuring no snacks are lost. I love the rubber bottom to prevent sliding and I love how the top portion is clear on the outside so you can see what is inside. The size is perfect for our kids to hold and reach their little hands into to feed themselves. The only gripe I have is that I wish there was some sort of leash to attach the lid to the cup.  Our kids have misplaced the lids numerous times and its really frustrating not to be able to use the cup because you can't locate the lid. Other than that, it's another perfect OXO product.",4
Boppy Newborn Lounger,This lounger is the perfect place for an infant. It's just the right angle and snugness. Our 8 week old sleeps swaddled on this. He has acid reflux and the position is great for him. He cannot sleep flat on his back because of the pain associated with his reflux. This is definitely my favorite and most used baby product!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased several of these for the grandchildren, and liked them so much; I ordered one for myself.  It puts stars all over the ceiling, and the walls.  The power went out the other night, and it was great having the light of the stars.  A great gift for kids of all ages.  I love mine.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"The truth be told, yes the volume is low.  It is not supposed to be a stereo system.  This is a perfect thing to have for a childs crib.  It shows them that music doesn't have to be blareing to be enjoyable and also this product isnt supposed to be used for loud music anyway.  That is why it is made for a crib!! To be soft and soothing, to lull your baby to sleep.  So for those who want a stereo type system to play music in the room i would suggest that you buy just that.  My baby goes to sleep more easily with the soft classical music playing. Oh! and another beautiful option.......you can change the cd's to whatever you want.  Unlike mobiles that only play selected songs over and over and over again.  As far as the batteries i have had this for 3 months and only had to change them one time and that was recent.  So inconclusion i would recommend this product.",5
Kidalog Baby Food Mill Grinder,"Love this food mill. We use it for the pureed food needed for a G-tube diet.  It would also be perfect for baby food.We have also used the Cuisinart mini chopper, the small size stainless old-fashioned food mill, the Magic Bullet, and the Munchkin food mill.My assessments:1. Cuisinart mini chopper: great for bigger tasks and for pureeing larger amounts to a smooth consistency2. Small Stainless old-fashioned food mill: does a great job, but too much food loss and trouble for small servings3. Magic Bullet: does not do small (1/4-1/2 cup) servings well.  Things get stuck to the sides and it doesn't puree them4. Munchkin food mill: lighter-weight than the Kidalog, blade pops out more easily ending up in a big mess, blades don't grind things like chicken and fish well.  The Kidalog grinds a variety of foods more easily.The Kidalog is the best when comparing the Munchkin to the Kidalog food mills because:The Kidalog is sturdier, has a wider more stable base; it does not leak; the center grinding disk stays in place well while grinding (Only turn crank Clockwise, as with the Munchkin, if you turn the crank the other direction, the grinding disk will be released ending up in a mess); he blade works better than the Munchkin ( I can't figure out why, but it works better); the Kidalog has a clear cover than can be placed on top as you grind which is usefulfor things that might squirt like blueberries.Easy to clean, no spots where food gets stuck.Suggestions:Gently press down on the base while you grind, allowing the blades to do the work especially on meats or items that are tougher. (This was a good suggestion from another reviewer).  Just stick to cranking Clockwise and all will work well.Takes a few more days to receive from Canada, but it is worth the wait!  I was impatient and bought the Munchkin first.",5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","These are great blankets.  Nice and big for swaddling.  Super soft, cute patterns, and lightweight.  Love them and would be a great gift for an expectant mom.",5
Tommee Tippee Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This is really handy.  I don't know if it's for everyone, but it is nice to stay there on the counter, put in some bottles, add water, turn it on and then 5 minutes later, sterilized bottles.  A whole lot quicker than boiling a pot of water, and those microwave bags are only good for a few uses.  Just de-scale once a month and your done.  It does make it easy.Only issue is that while other things can be put in there, the racks are designed for the Tommee Tippee bottles only.",4
Co-Pilot Model A Trailer,"This trailer is great. I recently bought this trailer over the Schwinn Spirit as it's features are by far better for a little more then $60 dollars more you get a light but sturdy steel frame with shock resistance shock on the trailer arm a padded seat over a nylon with a 5 point restraints with little holders Vs a aluminum frame & nylon seat & floor. Your kid basically sits on a nylon pad. Not bad really but the aluminum on this trailer tends to have it's issues and good luck getting parts. For me I just think it's well worth the $60 extra dollars for a much better product over all. I like the Schwinn and I certainly like the Cadillac of trailers but for a relative medium you can't go wrong with the CoPilot Model """"A"""". The model """"T"""" is pretty nice too but a little bit more then we was willing to spend.",5
Sesame Street Meal and Play Mat,The mat was very cute and colorful but too thin and i was afraid that the highchair will make holes through the mat. Unfortunately i had to return the product.,1
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","My baby is 5 weeks old and we've now used this carrier on 5 or 6 outings, namely dog walks. My baby was born large - 9 lbs, 10 ozs., so he was already heading out of the infant size requirements, but he still needs them, and the flexibility of this carrier for under 15 lbs. babies, along with the ability for a taller person to use it (my husband is 6'3&#34;) made this model really attractive to us (we didn't want to spend all the extra money on the infant insert and extra straps for taller people). This is really easy to put on and take off, even when you're by yourself, and my baby seems pretty happy in it (word to the wise, if you're using pacifiers, put one in your pocket so if the baby fusses when in the carrier, you can soothe him/her with the pacifier really easily).I was surprised at how high the baby sits when it's set up for the under 15 lbs. babies - I thought his neck would be a little more supported by the material, but his head seems to rest mostly above the canvas material, so I kind of hold it to keep him from bobbling around too much. I don't mind, but if you wanted a truly hands-free option, you might want to test-drive this before you commit.The colors and materials look just like they look online - I love it for my little boy, but definitely appropriate for either sex of child. Instructions are easy to follow. I got this as a gift, but had chosen it for my registry because of the things I outlined above and the price, and I'm still pretty happy with the decision.",5
"Cozy Infant Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Optic Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt and Zoom, 3.5 Inch","Pan And Tilt : Works fast and adds allot of convenience , the 3.5&#34;Bright screen lets me have better view , and its very nice and clear .I also found a very nice feature since we have 2 thermostats in ourhouse 1 for downstairs and 1 for upstairs , so when my baby takes hisdaily nap I can always monitor the temperature in his room with thenice feature that this monitor has, to always give me the roomtemperature on the monitor . I would like to mention 1 small issuethat I had and solved it so if you experience the same you know whatto do , usually it is not necessary to pair the camera to the monitorbecause it comes pared from the factory , only if you want to addadditional cameras ( it works up to 4 cameras ) or if you accidentallydelete the camera [ thats what happened to me ] so let me explain howto pare it since it took me a few minutes to figure it out. Firstswitch on the camera , then switch on the monitor , press the menubutton which is the top left button then on the screen to the bottomyou will see 7 options , choose the second to the right you choose bythe arrow buttons , then choose &#34; add&#34; then choose camera 1 , but hereis a little tricky when you choose camera 1 the screen will tell youto &#34; press pairing mode &#34; this is the &#34;on &#34; button on the camera , butonly press it for 1 second and leave it off right away then it shouldpare , don't press it for longer then that because it will switch offthe camera , the user manual says 2 seconds but thats to long , alsoif the light is red then that means you switched off the camera (because you pressed it to long) it hasto be orange and then you can pare it by pressing the &#34;on&#34; button for 1second , it will then blink fast and pare .Also if you set the screen to switch off and you only leave the sound, if the camera detects motion it will automaticity go back on witchis good so you see what the motion is . Other then that paring issueI don't have much to say to &#34; Cozy Infant &#34; other then you did agreat job by producing a rich nice baby monitor for a good price ,keep it up !!!!!! and it deserves a 5 star",5
"Summer Infant Slumbersack Longsleeve Microfleece, Blue Star","Baby grandson sleeps very comfortable in this sleeper. It seems a little longer then most, so he is able to have his legs free, but stays covered and warm. Love it !",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I had a different brand before, it was not as sturdy as this one.  Set up was super easy even for me.  I HIGHLY reccomend it",5
"Prince Lionheart playMAT, ABC","We were looking for a large play mat for our 8 month old son to keep him off the rental carpet.  This play mat is definitely large.  My husband, my son, and I can easily play on it together.  The thickness is about as thick as a foam place mat and it works great on the carpet.  I think this would be a great product to have on hard surface flooring to provide a little padding when crawling around.  If you are looking for something a little thicker, Prince Lionheart makes this same mat with thicker foam called the play mat plus.  I didn't feel it was necessary to spend the extra money because by the time we move and hopefully no longer have carpet, my son will not longer be rolling around and trying to sit up.  As far as other mats, I can't stand the ones that link together because I didn't want to deal with the mess after my son tore them apart.  Also, I really am not a fan of the crazy colors.  I know that sounds crazy because this mat is very colorful but I think the colors serve a purpose.  The roads and farm encourages play and it is very cute.  It folds up easily and can be put away quickly unlike the mats that link together.  If you have pets that have claws that may get on this mat, I would advise you to look for a different product.  The instructions even say not to use high heels, etc. on the mat.  The only negative I can really say about the mat is it does move around on the carpet a little and I find that I'm having to move it a few times a day.  Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.  If I had it on hard surface flooring, I would probably try a rug backing.  One last thing - super easy to clean.  It has had all sorts of baby mess on it and wipes clean.",5
"Silikids Universal Standard Large Siliskin, Lime","I chose to use glass bottles for fear of toxins (bpa) found in plastic bottles.The ""Siliskin"" fits over the bottles and protects from breakage if dropped or for protecting the diaper bag as well if packing one or more glass bottles on outings to parks, zoo ect. and the look is quite cute.",5
RiNGLEY Natural Teething Toy (Straight),"This teething ring is made very well. The materials seem high quality. Unfortunately, my son really goes for color, which I realized after I purchased this and he seemed to have little interest in it.  He uses it once in a while, but he's definitely not attracted to it. Too bad, because I would prefer he chew on something organic.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,This thing is junk and a waste of space. It does not twist correctly. The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it. Don't waste the money.,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss T-Shirt, Cat In The Hat, Blue, 18 Months","I bought this for a baby (girl) gift along with a few other Dr. Seuss items. It was a great addition to the Dr. Seuss theme I was going for, and the larger size (18 months) was greatly appreciated, because they could look forward to their baby wearing it later on vs. all the newborn or younger sizes people receive as baby gifts.",5
"NUK Gerber GraduatesFun Grips Trainer Cups, Boy, 7 Ounce, 4-Count","We have used these cups for years with my son, now I bought these for my daughter. They are great, except one of the cups in the set leaks 2 out of 3 times we use it. I have to keep taking the spout out and putting it back in to make it stop leaking. Maybe the spout so defective. I know they sell replacement spouts in our local store. Overall these are my favorite cups.",4
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,"I use my boppy pillow every day. Is great for nursing and holding my newborn.  This cover is very soft, great for baby's delicate skin.  Works wonders to keep your pillow stain free and all stains are gone after you put it in the washer.",5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - Jungle,"PROS:Great little floor mat- entertained baby from 2-4 months.Okay as chair for a short while, to keep baby entertained and out of the way (if you need to get something done).He loved being able to spin in it and that it bounces.Arch with koala and butterfly and dragon fly are interesting to baby.  Parrot is sometimes too.Baby liked to teeth on butterfly, and dragon fly was his favorite.  He tried to gum the other items, but obviously these were not super satisfying as they didn't fit in his mouth as well.Fold into flat disc when you need to put it away (for long term storage. Would be time-consuming for everyday clean up).CONS:We usually had to take the dragon fly out of its perch because he had to pull with all his might to reach it to his mouth.Not for tall children- will outgrow it quickly.Bird trio is pointless.  They don't do anything that baby can do (one's head bops, but you have to be older to ""operate"").World and Chameleon just play LOUD music, even on lowest setting.Alligator not interesting to baby.  May become interesting after first birthday, when he's able assemble the ""puzzle"".Chameleon and Globe require batteries and are pointless without.  Alligator also requires batteries (though could use without).In third stage it's RIDICULOUSLY UNSTABLE.  It totally wobbles and as soon as baby leaned on it, it toppled over.  What a joke.",3
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,5

"Bestever Baby Mat, Pink Bear","I don't have any children yet, but I have given the lamb to two friends and the giraffe to two others and they absolutely love it!!

"Graco Lauren Dressing Table, White","Initially my husband and I decided not to get a changing table.  But bringing my 20 month old into our room and changing her on the floor became tired quickly.  And now that I am currently 16 weeks pregnant, changing her on the floor slowly became no an option for me.  I've looked high and low for a nice decent changing table for a fair price.Pros:Goes great with my toddlers decor (other furniture is made by Carter's)I love the different shelvesPurchased from Amazon for $69.99; it's currently priced at $99.99 at Babies-R-UsHolds children up to 30 lbs (My daughter is 19 pounds 14 ounces, so we have some time with this product)Ship to our house two days after purchasingDid not take my husband long to put the changing table togetherThis item can be re-purposed for a shelf somewhere else in the house one day.Cons:The one locking wheel does not lockOverall great product for the price; I wish I would have found this sooner...",5
Klean Kanteen 18 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle (Sport Cap 2.0) - Indicator Red,"This water bottle is used by my preschool son every day. The sport cap is leaking badly when I put sparkling water in it, but I have never seen one that didn't. Apart from that I am satisfied and my son is too.",4

"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","We bought the gate to keep our kids out of the kitchen while we cooked dinner.  You get what you pay for!  Not the most sturdy gate and our walls are angled so makes it difficult to latch closed.  Not bad, but not sure I would buy it again.",3
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This gate is awesome! I read too many reviews before deciding on the one. Look no further!!!!I had used a few at friends houses and hated the ones with the latches on the top... they were hard to open. The latch on the bottom of this one is so easy to use, but the kids can't figure it out. Actually most adults that come over can't figure it out either :)Very sturdy. My daughter is very gentle and doesn't pull or hang on it (she is 2), but I have had some hellians over that have practically tried to rip it down and it held up just fine! Very durable. We have been using this at the top of the stairs with the included hardware for 6 months now. We did not drill into the wall or anything and the nice sticker/adhesive parts have worked very well!",5

Safety 1st Prograde Complete Family Thermometer,"We've only used the rectal attachment for our baby (now 10 months). It is very unreliable. Frequently, we will take his temperature and then take it again 30 seconds later & the readings are sometimes vastly different.  When your baby is sick, you don't want the uncertainty of not knowing if there's fever or how high the fever is. I am now looking for something more reliable.",1
"OXO Tot Whale Pail, Blue",Like the 2 different ways to attach (suction or sticky tabs) the back piece. I was not aware it was two separate pieces when i purchased it but it makes sense to be that way. the feet on the bottom of the mounting piece also work well for holding up the weight. drains well with the 3 separate areas to drain. very happy.,5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","Our baby loves all things shiny. Which means he was fascinated with the bathtub spout. Unfortunately, one day he stood up beneath it and got scratched by it. That is when we found Moby the spout cover. Moby was very easy to install and slips right onto the spout. We live in an apartment so we have the basic standard faucet which Moby was designed for. Moby has a clever design (hole for shower pull and slit down middle) which allows it to slip right on the faucet. Moby's mouth goes low enough that the baby is well protected from future scraps. Moby fits snug on the faucet and so far our baby has not figured out how to remove Moby. Our baby loves the little whale and will often speak whale to it. OoooooOOOOoooo! I think they are getting along quite well.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness, Monkey",It was surprisingly bigger than I though but that made me happy. My daughter won't wear it very long but we will keep trying. It is very handy if you are just going on a short trip and want to not lug around a diaper bag or to just keep snacks and toys separate. We also used it on our flight from the West coast to the East. But it ended up being more of a pain to keep track of. Hopefully as she gets bigger she will like it better. She does like to play with it for now.,3
Vulli Products - Sophie The Giraffe Teething Ring - Gift Boxed! - 100% Natural rubber,"I've had the original Sophie for both my daughter and my son and LOVED them. This teething ring version was suggested and I thought I'd give it a try since we're such a ""Pro-Sophie"" family. My son is four months old and teething big time. I got this delivered yesterday and he has been non stop gnawing on it. There is drool EVERYWHERE. It's great for his small hands to be able to hold and much easier than the regular Sophie. (Although he still loves her too) I'll be recommending this to friends from now on! Oh, and the packaging it comes in is super cute as well. :)",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"The calendar was given to me as a gift. It's functional and serves its purpose but could use some improving. It seems a bit out dated for my taste, as if it was designed nearly 50 years ago. Because you have to fill in the dates, Sunday isn't always on the left where a traditional calendar would place it. The stickers are an adorable feature, but it's for those mom's to be who are looking for a more medical pregnancy labor and delivery. I liked that it would tell me the fetal development but when I purchase another pregnancy calendar I will not be getting this calendar.",4
Levana LV-TW502 Safe N' See Advanced 3.5-Inch Digital Video Wireless Baby Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom and Remote Controlled Lullabies,"Wireless camera is great and the video control panel handheld is just great! Quality is very good considering it is wireless and handheld runs on batteries. You can talk to baby wirelessly, it has an included remote control and even has a nightlight! It has night vision so you can check up on baby when it's dark, controls can be voice controlled (just be sure to not speak too fast and clearly and it works 100% flawless) It even has a temperature monitor and even plays 5 included lullabies! Setup is fast and easy and you will be spying on baby in no time! For the price I do not think this can be beat as it works better and has tons more features of the same other products that cost 2,3,4 times as much!",5
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena","Easy and simple! Love it for traveling and overnights at the grandparents house! No extras are needed, it's great! Would recommend to anyone",4
Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,"I purchased this product because it looked more attractive in the picture than the Teething Bling I used with my daughter. I was wrong. I'm a little embarrassed to wear this necklace because it really does just look like a big teething ring. Plus baby likes the Teething Bling better, go figure.Don't spend the extra money on Chewbeads. This product is just too much rubber for any one person's neck.",2
Baby Trend Activity Walker,"Our daughter is 8 months old and we found this walker to be very very short. We put it on the highest setting and she was still walking around with bent knees. Also the wheel's are small and the square plastic base of the walker is low making it impossible to make it over a tiny lip of a thin area rug from hardwood floor. We bought Safety 1st Sounds 'N Lights Activity Walker and its much taller.  However the two giant giraffe's on the front of the walker prevented a lamp form falling on my daughter so for that I am very grateful. There is also a very nice tray on the front for snacks and the walker overall was well constructed, just too short.",2
Isabella 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set by Glenna Jean,"We would like to pay a little more for quality. This set is very pretty and elegant. It makes the crib look incredible., We got a lot compliments.",5
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Velour Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover, Mocha",This Velour contoured changing cover is very soft & it washes up nicely. It fits the contoured pad the way it should. I am also impressed with the company and the way my ordered was processed and received. They have a great name and a cute picture frame magnet that I now have on my fridge to help me remember where to order from the next time a I need an item like this.,5
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety Brackets,"I used this to hold up a bookcase, especially with little children around. Better to be safe than sorry.  Easy to install.",5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Night and Day Discovery Toy,"Just as adorable as shown in picture, maybe even more so. This item arrived a day early and was in perfect condition. Will make a great gift for christmas, I think my niece will just love it!",5
"Toilet Seat Covers- Disposable XL Potty Seat Covers, Individually Wrapped by Potty Shields - Extra-Large, No Slip (Floral- 6 Pack)",These are so convienient and the simple packaging makes taking a single cover where ever you go easy.  Definitely recommended.,5
"Itzy Ritzy Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Avocado Damask","The pattern on this is so cute. I gave it 5 stars mainly based on that. It does its job, nothing really spectacular about it except its so cute and soft. The rings to hang toys on are definitely handy. Fits on most carts. Doesn't fold back up very easily but that's because it is very cushiony.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I needed to replace a worn out cover and bought one of these to try with my son. After three babies in cloth diapers, I have tried quite a few different brands and this is one of the better diaper covers. I like these better than the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap because the cut seems to fit my baby better around the legs. It fits nicely and doesn't gap around the legs, but hasn't left any red marks, either (my son has very chubby legs). I use it both with prefolds and with bumGenius fitted bamboo diapers. The cover is much trimmer than other covers I've tried and fits pretty well under his clothes. The blackbird pattern is super cute, and I also love the adjustable rise. I bought the larger size and am optimistic that it will last up to 40 pounds. My son is 24 pounds and it looks like he has plenty of room to grow. My only drawback is the price....although it's very competitively priced with similar diaper covers, it's still a chunk of money. I would have made the investment if I was buying them for my first baby, but as this is for my last baby, I'll probably only buy one or two more as I need to replace worn out covers.",4
CoCaLo Once Upon A Pond Plush Turtle,I bought this for my sister in law and she just adores it! My niece even tries to steal it from her!,5
"Tubing for Medela Lactina, Symphony and Pump in Style Breast Pumps. Retail Pack, 2pc/pack. BPA Free, Replacement of Medela Tubing Part# 8007213, 8007194, 8007179, 87214, 87213",Works the same as the medela brand tubing.  No compatibility issues though there is a slight design difference compared to the brand name version.  They are a good value for the money.,5
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,A must have for your baby he will love itthe color doesn't go out A 5 star quality and the baby can hold it easily . I order many other Teether but this is the best one I will order another one as a gift to my friend baby,5
"Dr. Sears Smoothie Sipper, Green, 18 Months","This works really well for smoothies and other foods that are more difficult to feed from a spoon because of being too liquid-y. My only complaint is that if there's only a little bit in the bottle, it's harder to get, and my daughter is only 9 months old and doesn't need a full bottle full of smoothie. I find that I have to put in twice as much as she would eat just to make sure she's able to get it, and that means a lot is wasted.I know there were a lot of complaints about the straw, but my daughter doesn't have teeth enough yet to cause any damage and she doesn't seem to bite the straw so that doesn't affect us (yet).",4
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I received it very promptly but I really have not had a chance to use it yet as my situation has changed. I hope to be able to use it very soon.,4
Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle,out of the box my daughter choose this toy out of all the rest some thing so simple its amazing,4
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Jumperoo,"Our little 5 month old can't get enough of this thing. She absolutely loves it - bouncing around in it, fooling around with all the little gizmos on the side. It's a great way to keep her in one place or to tire her out.The reason I gave it four stars was simply because it should have come with an AC Adapter, instead it uses batteries, and it blows through them like crazy. The first week we went through 8 AA batteries before I decided to buy rechargeable ones. We're still changing them every few days and I simply leave the battery cover off so I don't have to fiddle with the screws that hold the cover in place.Overall, a great product, but the battery issue should have been addressed by Fisher Price.",4
Barefoot Dreams Hello Kitty CozyChic Mini Blanket,"But quite tiny in size. I hope my granddaughter carries it around when she's older, because way too tiny to use as a blanket.  So soft tho, just a little disappointed on size for cost.",4
Garanimals Wooden Stacking Rings,Terrible toy.  I bought this for my child this weekend and already the toy looks like I've had it for years.  It is not durable and the paint chips off.  That can't be safe.  My child will no longer be playing with this.,1
"Similac infant nipples &amp; rings, Standard Flow, Ready To Use, Case of 25",Fits the newborn formula bottles they give in the hospital. Helpful for nighttime feedings. You don't have to wash them. Just open a new one every day. They aren't recommended for multiple uses.,5
NUK OrthoStar Design Pacifiers Boys Color (2pk),My son loved pacifiers when he was little and these were his favorite. I found they stayed in his mouth the best.,5
"Dr. Brown's Protective Bottle Sleeve (4 oz), 4 Pack - Pink",A little more difficult to heat evenly but good for around tile counter tops. the baby can even get a better grip,5
NUK Barely There Nipple Shield with Case,"Only bought for the case.  For the price, it's great for this--just used my Medela nip shield, which is far superior but doesn't have its own case.",2
Sassy Developmental Rock And Roll Infant Play Gym,"The rock and roll gym musical star will last a few weeks.  Our's started to act up after about two weeks and now doesn't work at all.  You would think that you can open the zipper compartment and just replace the battery, but unfortunately it's not even a zipper compartment.  I cut the star open to search for a battery and there is no battery that a consumer could replace.  Save the money and hassle and buy one from either Fisher Price or Tiny Love.",1
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","Great for the price, not to difficult to put together. Only negative is that are boy is 3 and will grow out of this bed within a year or two. It's perfect for a quick fix.",4
Easy Folding Travel Potty,"I keep this potty in the back of my van and really appreciate that I don't have to look for a gas station when I'm out and about with my children. My kids range in age from 7 down to 1, so it is great to set up the potty in the back of the van and not have to haul all four of them into a random store to ask for a bathroom.  It is so easy to use, it makes pit stops quick and simple.",5
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","This has been an often used item for our little one. Good for fun, especially when he was small. Kept him entertained and sitting with us. Great as a make shift high chair on the floor in the living room. I haven't used it as a booster yet but it has been fun and practical for us. Very useful!",5
Mod Ladybug 4-Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set,"Absolutely love this bedding, it's super cute and you don't see lady bugs often! I love how the blanket is not real thick, my sons was thick and we did not use it but this one is like a quilt and I think we will use it when she is like 6 months or so..great quality, nice and soft..would recomend this bedding to anyone looking for something different..we bought the 4 pc crib set and mobile, we also got the curtain..so cute but does not come with the pok a dot curtains just the top one, I love it though!",5
Flip-Down Child View Mirror,It was a pain to get on and only works well with thicker mirrors.  The straps fit into the grooves on the safety first mirror and the hooks hook onto the bottom side of your vehicles rearview mirror.  It's a tight fit but stays in place well.  Hope this helps :),5
"Medela Tubing for Pump In Style Original &amp; Advanced breast pumps #87212, retail pack of 2","The tubes work just fine. I've been using them for a month without issue. The problem is I get milk in them almost every time, and I never had a problem like that with my Medela brand tubing. I wonder if they are just a little bit wider, allowing the milk in. I have to clean them after every use, which is tiresome. Should have paid for the Medela tubes which are over priced, but less hassle.",3
"Baby Bottle Labels, Self-laminating - Great for Daycare","this is a great product , very very helpful..my wife was so happy - the stickers are on bottles/lunch containers for about couple of months..and still not coming off. awesome",5
Better Bath Ultimat Bath Mat (Clear) 39 1/2&quot; long x 16&quot; wide,This is a great bath mat that fits the entire length of the tub.  Minor drawback-You do have to hang it up to dry after each use or else it will mildew very quickly.,5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this when pregnancy forced me to start sleeping on my side.  I've never been a side sleeper and initially tried wedging normal pillows around me.  That didn't work so I eventually sought out this fabulous item.  It has literally made the difference between me being well rested or exhausted and uncomfortable all night long.  I was initially concerned because of the seam issue raised in a previous review.  However, when the pillow arrived, I found that although the seam might be uncomfortable, the issue was 100% resolved simply by placing a pillow on top of this one in the area where your head will go - thus covering the seam and eliminating any potential discomfort.  The pillow is large - if you have anything smaller than a queen sized bed you or your partner might need a new place to snooze, however, the size is what makes it comfortable.  At night I can roll over without having to relocate anything but myself.  Since it wraps around, it mostly prevents accidentally sleeping on my stomach or back which could be harmful to baby and it's substantive without being too big to be cuddly as the person inside it.  This pillow is amazing and I'd highly recommend it if sleeping on your side doesn't come naturally to you.",5
Kiddopotamus Tiny Diner &amp; Bibbity 2-Pack Gift Set - Pink,"Great products, really good deal.  We used our previous placemat about 100 times with our older child.  Can be used anywhere.",5
Fisher Price Magical Sound N Lights Mirror,"I had no problem installing this mirror and it works great for me to keep an eye on my baby when driving.  The light show and music are nice but the music is too low even at the highest setting which makes ita problem when it get noisy on the road, other than that its a good product and it attaches safely to the head rest.",4
Trendsport Lite Stroller,"I thought this was an excellent stroller with the looks, storage space, lightness and other features UNTIL it folded on me.  My daughter is 21 months and 25lb, not a heavy load.  She got her finger stuck in between the bars and the skin got sheared off the tip.  This stroller folded on me a total of 4 times in 1 month before she got injured and I returned it. Be especially careful over curbs, train tracks or any type of a bump in the sidewalk.",1

Its best to spend the extra bucks on the actual models tubes and not this.,2
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"I was in an accident this morning in which I hit a tree with the side of my van and then spun 270 degrees.  My toddler son, who was rear-facing in this seat, wasn't even shaken - though I think the van is totaled.  I will be ordering the exact same thing to replace that seat, now that it's been in an accident.",5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","The small separate container works great, the tops require some effort to pry off but that works well against spillage.However the larger container where it works very easily to just pour one serving into a bottle, when the container bounced around a bit in my bag, it ended up mixing up all of the formula and I had to re-measure it which defeats the purpose. If you can keep it upright all the time it's fine but when trying to measure precisely and have it stay that way, this doesn't work 100%",2
Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump,"This pump didn't make good suction for me. The most I got out of it was 20ml. Also, after about a week it started making loud squeaking noises. The only good thing I got out of it was the bottle. I wish I would have returned the pump but I didn't.",1
"Evenflo Discovery 5 Infant Car Seat, Confetti Aruba","Just bought this car seat a few weeks ago for our daughter who came home from the hospital almost a month after she was born due to a heart condition that required her to have open heart surgery at a week old. As far as car seats go, this one is amazing. Not only is it adorable, durable and easy to hold, but it makes me feel so much better to have her in a car seat that doesn't jostle her when we are walking or driving thanks to all the padding and sturdy design. For a delicate baby like ours, or any baby for that matter, this is perfect.",5
Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,"I'm expecting twins in January 2005 and my daughter will be 17 months old upon their arrival. I'm looking for a good triple stroller that won't break the bank. Preferably something that will fit into my car, is easy to operate, and has a car seat that can attach into as a travel system !Please write to me .... gia.annecca@nextel.comThanks !",1
The First Years Compass Premier Folding Booster Car Seat in Daisy,"This is the best car seat! It's slight tilt helps my daughters head not fall forward when she falls asleep in the car, and the side head rest are big enough for her to rest. It's adjustable to grow with her. AND most improtantly i feel that she is safe in it. The pattern and colors are great.",5
Safety 1st Prograde No Drill Top Of Door Lock,"I agree with the other positive reviews: including, installs and removes in seconds. For a trip to ""Grandma's house"", I took them off our doors and then popped them on the doors at my mom's place. Quickly childproofing the rooms our toddler shouldn't enter.The only con is the relatively high price compared to other childproofing methods. But it's so sturdy it looks like I can resell it when we're done.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,Our 3 month old had been going through an awful sleep regression for about two weeks straight and I was getting desperate.  He goes to bed at 8:00pm and used to sleep in his own crib til around 4:00-4:30am.  Then for two weeks he was up around midnight and in bed with us at that point every night.  His first night in the sleepsuit he slept from 8:00pm to 7:30am in his crib without making a peep!  Second night he slept from 8:00pm to 7:00am and we are entering our third night right now. It has helped lengthen out his naps as well. It really helps muffle his reflexes and is comfortable so he feels like he is in bed with us!  I NEEDED my bed back and my sleep back and this is our saving grace!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink",It folds up just like a lawn chair and has a carrying bag very light in weight. I have it in my office in case i have one of my daughters sick for the day. she states it is comfy.,5
"Boon Orb Bottle Warmer,Green","Easy to use and heats the bottle quickly. We were given another warmer and the milk is not as wrm and is takes longer and is a much bigger warmer. My only concern is, that on the small 4oz bottles the hot steam gets under the cap. Even after drying the bottle is hot for the little fingers that want to hold on. No problems with the larger bottles. Love the compact size.",4
"Aden by aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Security Blanket, Safari Friends - Giraffe",My son loves these!  I like that they hold up wash after wash!,5
"Disney Umbrella Stroller with Canopy, Sweet Silhouettes","I am a grandma, new one, and this stroller is light and easy for me to pick up, fold up and store it. It appears to be well built and the designed fabric is adorable.  Great for quick trips, shopping, etc.",5
"Kissa's One Size Wet Diaper Bag, Mocca Swirl","I have really enjoyed our wetbag.  While at first I was concerned that it would be too small, it has actually been the perfect size for our day outings when we are running errands etc.  I would say that we have been able to fit about four of our fitted diapers into it no problem.  I love that it fits easily into our diaper bag without taking up too much room, it keeps the smell contained, and the cute prints are a plus.  I also think this wetbag has held up better than any other ones I have owned and it is very reasonably priced.",5
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Blue","After spending a lot of money replacing chewed up or non-spill proof spill proof cups, this cup was a God send. Well worth the money.",5
Munchkin 'White Hot' Duck Bath Toy,"It stays upright and clean, but once the thermometer chages to hot a few times, it permanantly stays there. The idea is great, but the function needs work.",3
Marinoff Low Vision Playing Cards,My 87 yr old Mom is a hit at her card parties - everyone wants to use her low vision cards.,5
"Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink",This seemed like a good idea but if you keep it rolled up it is hard to unroll. It flips back up when you put it on you baby. And the bottom cup does not stay open all the way so it defeats the purpose of catching all the extra food. I never actually used it much. I preferred a thinner fabric one that would mold better to the babies chest and could be thrown in the wash.,3
Moses Basket Set of 2 Sheets - color pink,"These are nice sheets for my trend labs Moses basket. They fit 29&#34; by 11&#34;. The only downside is the coloring. They are barely pink at all, it looks more like someone threw in something pink with the whites when washing :) The quality is good and they hold up in the washing machine well. They also fit nicely on the pad without being to tight or to loose.",4
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I love this stroller. It is tall enough for me to push comfortably and I don't kick the back wheels. The basket is hard to access when the seat is reclined, but that's not very often. It has a cup holder and zippered pouch to keep my keys, phone, wallet, etc. The wheels turn smoothly and I don't have any issues like I did with the $15 Walmart special.",5
"J.L. Childress Side Sling Stroller Cargo Net, Black","This mesh bag is great. Fits different brands and styles of strollers. Very easy to install. I liked it so much, I bought a second one!",5
"Bunnies by the Bay My &quot;Furst&quot; Purse, Bunny","I got these for an Easter present and they are more like big coin purses than a regular purse, but they are soft. they are overpriced for the amount of product......  I was pretty disappointed for the cost.",2
"Kathe Kruse Stuffed Grabbing Toy, Giraffe","My youngest LOVES this, he cannot go to bed without it.  It has stained a bit after lots of teething done on it's poor ears and head.  Overall though it stands up to everything!  He carries it around by the neck.  Worth the money!",4
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","This is a very nice wrap style carrier. The only downfall is it takes quite a bit of practice to get it right. I suggest looking up baby K'tan on youtube, they have some videos of the different holds.",4
Nook LilyPad Playmat (Poppy - Bright Orange),"This is thick and soft and looks nice in my living room because it doesn't scream &#34;baby.&#34;  I throw it into the washing machine and it's held up well.  I've been using it for a year, and I'm still very happy with it.",5
"Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White","Our 20 lb dog knocks it over. Hard to get a grip on smooth wall surfaces. Also, it falls into several pieces when it comes down, kind of annoying. Overall it does the job but if you have a bigger dog you at have a hard time keeping him contained if he jumps up on the gate.",3
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),"I used the Kidsme Food Feeder to give our niece peeled and mashed grapes. She chewed on it immediately til it was down to a small amount.  The large size fit in her mouth (10 mos old) but I sent for the replacement small size (2 per pack) because it&#699;s an easier fit at this point.You have to shake it a couple times when there&#699;s not much left because chewing/sucking on it pushes the remaining food up into the neck. I also rough puree then free pear, watermelon, cantelope etc. then break it up and put it into the feeder.  She likes it- gets a little messy but not like handing her a fruit pop.  But it&#699;s easy to clean and the silicone is nice and soft but strong.  Shape works but you can&#699;t fill it too full or it won&#699;t close.",5
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Mobile, ABC","Very cute, perfect over crib.",4
"JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Umbrella Strollers, Red","This worked great to store the bassinet from our stroller and gate check it. The bassinet is super light. However, after only 1 use there was a tear in it. They are inexpensive enough that I will buy another one...$11 is nothing in order to ensure that our $200 bassinet stays safe at gate check.",4
"Dr. Brown's Breastmilk Collection Bottles, 4 Pack","these are great. I have a the playtex embrace double pump and these fit perfectly. These are also a lot cheaper than the playtex bottles. They are lined up to 3 ozs but you can fit 4 ozs of milk in them. They have a solid, one piece lid so there is no chance of leaking. They took longer than I expected to arrive but they work so well that I still give them the 5 stars.",5
"Mini Orchestra, Set of 4",Best toy we have bought. Loves to make music and it exactly the same as the set that is sold by gymboree.,5
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","At first, I was skeptical to order because of the price compared to other&#8217;s online.  However, I was not disappointed when we received it.  It&#8217;s perfect for the nursery&#8230;..even though its ivory, it still matches the room (white furniture).  Material is super soft and comfortable, gotta love washable slipcovers.  I have no issues with the back height or any noise/squeak when rocking or swiveling.  Can&#8217;t wait to rock baby girl to sleep in this.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I have 2 of these large bags, and keep them in rotation. I cloth diaper my twins, and wash about every other day. There is never any stink and nothing leaks through the bag.  It's easy to just toss right in the washing machine along with the diapers. It holds 12-14 soiled diapers easily.When washing, just be sure to turn the bag fully inside out.  I didn't a couple of times, and, well I guess it continued to do it's jon right there in the washer because when I took it out, it was actually full of water.  So, pull the liner fully out and it will be smooth sailing.",5
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BESTS PURCHASES OF MY LIFE!First of all you will love this soooo stable and secure base!I have twins, i can move and place the chairs SO SAFELY in practically ANY SURFACE AT MY HOME!it makes me so easy to feed them! because I put them on the top of my dinning table and I can feed them on my feet (for me it is very uncomfortable to feed them sitting down!)both babies are comfortable!!!! they love their chair!!!and also the cover is soooooo wash machine safe! and they look perfect! as new before washing them!I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL (Because the new one does not has a soooo secure base)",5
"American Baby Company Teddy Bear Terry Cradle Set, Ecru",This is a beautiful cradle set!! Very satisfied with the thickness and the look of the comforter. Could not be happier!,5
DadGear The Classic Messenger Diaper Bag - Coal Black,"Simple, sturdy, slim to carry, not too much pockets where you forget where you put stuff, should last longer then 2.5 years, shoulder strap is firm with shoulder pad just at the right space, grab handles are subtle what it turns out it's better that way so won't easily tangle with stuff around, light color wall inside is easy to see, the wipe dispenser is easy/quick to get to, water resistence, can stand up on it's own when you have stuff insideAreas for improvements: find way to shorten or store the left-over strap which can be a bit annoying, find ways to dampen the metal-clicking sound from all the little zippers",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My son loves to play ""dino world"" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"I purchased this when I was still pregnant. My 10 week old has a cold and this is the first time I've had to use it. I much prefer it over the standard bulb! I was always scared that with the standard bulb he would move and I would accidentally jam it up his nose. He still fusses, but this is much faster so he doesn't have to fuss for as long, much easier to clean, and safer for him!***update** Now that my baby is older, 16 months, I find that the length of the tube may be a little too long. Since it's harder for him to sit still while I do it, it's so long that it can twist and curl up, which makes it hard to use. But I still prefer it over the bulb! I did bring it down a star because I purchased the Nosefrida and prefer that over BabyComfyNose now.",4
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Lavender Topaz,"We got this for our 7 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  The first time she saw it she said, &#34;I'm speechless!&#34;",5
"Best Bottom Stay Dry Inserts, Large, 3 Count","I've used a variety of cloth covers and inserts.  These are my favorites by far!  Let me start by saying this system is so easy and convenient.  The inserts snap in so you can have diapers ready as easy as pockets without the extra work.  And are daddy and sitter friendly!  They are super absorbent but without the smell factor that always comes with microfiber.  Thick layers, but still give a trim fit.  I'm buying more.  I wish I had tried these first.  I've got a bunch of pocket covers I won't use anymore, and a good amount of inserts that just don't perform as well.  We are using the medium sized right now, and they are absorbent enough for overnight.  That may change as he grows though.  The best absorbency I can compare these to are Thirsties hemp prefolds, which come second only because I have to fold them.  I'm a fan of the snap in ease of these.  Even if they aren't snapped in, they still work amazing in other covers.  But Best Bottoms are my fav covers too.  Trim and I love that I don't have to swap out a new cover with every change, they keep my baby dry (not in wet leaked on clothes all the time) and wash up great.",5
"Kidkusion Gummi Grip Shopping Cart Handle Cover, Green","My husband is a self-proclaimed germophobe and always hated that the grocery store was out of disinfectant wipes for the buggies. I bought him this as a gift, and he now keeps it in his car. He does not like going shopping without it - we use it all the time. We always get questions about what it is, and when we tell people they think it is ingenious and ask where we got it. It is very easy to use, comfy, and alleviates our worries about germs.",5
Lansinoh mOmma Straw Cup Replacement Straws,I really like being able to get there. The bottle was my sons favorite however chewing is a problem but it is a problem with all of the bottles with soft straws... he already torn up every bottle with a soft straw. As he got older though these lasted longer and we got better at watching him.,5

Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"Super easy to use.  Just drop in a pre-made bottle from the fridge, and hit the button to warm.  Great product!",5
"Safety 1st Space Saver Infant Tub, Blue",This is a safe beautifull firts bath tub for a baby. The packaging perfect and delivered on time. I am very happy with this purchase.,5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"As soon as my daughter was interested in toys, this became her favorite place to be! She loves batting and kicking the different animals.  It's pretty expensive for what it is (thank you mother-in-law!), but baby girl can lie on the mat for 20-30 minutes and will play by herself, and I haven't found anything else that will entertain her for that long. The Skip Hop products are generally more attractive than other kids' brands and this was no exception. There are rattles and crinkle noises, but nothing too gaudy, and the tree theme is charming.",5
"NUK Hello Kitty Silicone Spout Learner Cup, 5 Ounce","Cup is easy for her to hold and drink out of, but very resistant to spilling. Other cups have been too difficult to drink or to easy to spill - this one is a good balance of both.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I hardly ever right reviews but feel the jumperoo is very over rated and not accurately reviewed. I have a five month old son and research every product for him almost excessively, and going by all the stellar reviews from multiple sources, I thought it would be great.  We have had the FP rainforest jumperoo for two months and he does not  play in it for longer than fifteen minutes and really is bored after ten. He enjoys his Tiny Love play mat more than his jumperoo. The basics of the jumperoo toys are 3 spin toys- a little redundant-they all do the same thing, the peek a boo tiger does not work properly it barely lifts up enough and there is an elephant that is supposed to be pushed around - but it snaps back with force - could be a safety hazard. I should have gone with an evenflo stationary play station which has a better variety of of toys baby can engage with.",2
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"I was told that the brown bulb suctions from the hospital were the best suctions out there....wrong! My sister, a nurse, introduced me to the nosefrida. &#34;It's the best thing ever&#34;, she said. So after our 2nd respirtory infection and many mattress raised, humidified nights without relief I took the plunge and bought the frida. Needless, to say we have never looked back! Also it is more hygenic. You can actually clean all the parts. I have heard horror stories of what the inside of those bulb suctions look like when cut open even after being &#34;cleaned&#34;. Bye Bye brown bulb suction...Hello Nosefrida!",5
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",Perfect way to have a safer situation so children cannot pull out the pieces of outlet plugs and choke on them.,5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Baby doesn't like this feedback around her, she won't allow it. Great quality though. Very impressed with the quality of this item",1
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","It is everything I was hoping it would be.  Very easy to assemble, only the top portion and the base, lightweight and cozy.  As in previous reviews the cupholders are pretty useless, but I wasn't looking for cupholder usability when I was shopping for a car safety seat for my daughter.I would highly recommend this product.",5

Munchkin Caterpillar Spillers Stacking Cups,My son loves bathtime thanks to these stacking cups which keep him happily occupied.  He even plays with them out of the bath.  We plan on taking them along to the beach during his first trip there in a couple of months.,4
"Infantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds","This is a fine carrier for the price at around 2/3 the cost of a Bjorn, but there are a number of difficult aspects that make it inferior.  Just spring for the Bjorn.This product is advertised as being able to put it on yourself, but it's necessarily a two-man job both to put it on and to remove it.  Once it's on, however, it's quite stable if a little tight.If you've ever used a Bjorn, you'd probably chuckle watching someone try to strap the Infantino on.  A Bjorn is elegant.  You put on the shoulder straps and then attach the carrier to them.  With the Infantino, it's awkward.  You put on one shoulder, clip the waistband around your back, slide the baby in, put on the other shoulder and then attempt to attach the side clips.  There's also another clip on the back at your shoulder blades that locks the shoulder straps in place.  My wife and I could not do it by ourselves -- with or without balancing a baby at the same time.  You have to be in the circus to perform those maneuvers by yourself.I seriously question whether the Infantino could comfortably support a 35 lb baby.  Sure, the thing ain't going to fail on you and drop your kid to the ground, but our 8 lb babies are already pressed fairly tight to our chests and there's not much adjusting room left.Other elements that make it inferior to a Bjorn are the fact that you can't place your baby facing forward and the fact that your baby must straddle your stomach (where as the legs hang down in a Bjorn), which must lead to some hip stress for the child.Overall this is a very average carrier that should definitely cost under $35.",3
"Kolcraft Cuddle 'N Care 2-in-1 Bassinet and Incline Sleeper, Emerson",Not very pleasing to look at but does the job. The stars that hang on top are too high for newborn to see. The music is ok except for the singing. Its kind of freaky. I never use the light or vibration feature. Also I dont use the inclince because I feel its too soft and puts baby into a very awkward position. Its a pain to switch from rocking bottom to wheels because you have to get the floor and do each wheel one by one which isn't a problem but it isn't sobering you can do quickly while baby is lying in it.. Overall just ok...,3
Naturepedic Non Waterproof Airflow Mattress Topper Crib Flat,"I didn't get this for the air flow reasons, but moreso because I thought the naturepedic mattress I have felt really hard.  I wanted some type of soft mattress topper and nontoxic.  This is pricey, but I think it makes the mattress much more comfortable for my son.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),it should be a bit smaller so it can go inside the nose .It is really hard to get the stuff out of baby's nose. I think it is a waste of money.,2
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I first bought a miracle blanket to use when my son came home from the NICU.  As a family physician, I'd read the evidence that swaddling comforts/calms babies and after all he'd been through as a preemie, I wanted to make him as comfortable as possible.  We used the Miracle Blanket every day, mostly in the evenings when he seemed to be more fussy than usual.  After a couple of weeks, he would just see the blanket and you could see his little brain think, ""Aaaaahhhh!"".  We used it during feeding and swaddled him before we put him in his crib in it to sleep at night and at nighttime.  I loved the fact that is is soft and very long (for wrapping the baby like a burrito).  The arm flaps took a bit of practice, but within no time, I was able to coordinate putting them over his arms and the ends of the flaps under his back in one fluid motion.  Four years later, after my daughter was born, someone gave us a swaddling blanket with velcro.  I tried it for her but even at two weeks old she was able to break her arms out of it.  I brought out the Miracle Blanket again and used it until she was 3-4 months old.  Now, I give the Miracle Blanket to all my friends and families who are expecting new babies.  As I tell them, it really is a ""miracle."" I recommend you look at YouTube for several good videos showing how to put the baby in the blanket.",5
Summer Infant Complete Nursery Care Kit Girl,"Brush, comb, nail clippers, teether, emery boards, finger toothbrush, gum massager are all great and useful items.Aspirator doesn't work well at all. It has yet to suck in a booger. I ended up just using the one we got from the hospital.The cap on the pacifier medicine dispenser won't close once you open it.The bag isn't as useful as everything gets mixed up. They don't stay in their ""compartments"".FINAL VERDICT: Worthy urchase, but may find it cheaper in stores. I wanted it in pink but now that she's here, I don't even care about the colour.",3
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal","I like the pattern.  It's durable, and the color is pretty.  Just the material is a little bit hard.  After washing several times, it's still not very soft.",4
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","These work great!!!!! And, when company comes, they can easily take off and put back on-",5
Safety 1st ProGrade 4 Latches No Drill Magnetic Cabinet and Drawer Latches,"We installed these locks on a couple cabinets in our kitchen.  One lock is not currently working, but I think it was an installation error.  My husband just needs to place it a little higher on the door.  These are great and keep our daughter from chemicals and other dangerous things under the sink.",4
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Adorable Sleepsack, cute as a button and very well made. I would recommend this product. Makes a great baby shower gift for mommy to be.",5
"The First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy","The hospital where was son was born uses these pacifiers. At first I was worried about nipple confusion and concerned that the hospital gave him a pacifier without asking me. Using the Soothie pacifiers he has had no problem with nipple confusion.He LOVES these things. We were given several different types of pacifiers as gifts at my shower and when we got home we gave them to him. He spit every one of them out immediately. The only pacifier he would use was this pacifier.It's shaped the same as a nipple from a bottle and I think that shape is much easier for him to suck on.Like I said, I was initially worried about nipple confusion, but there are some times when he just wants to suck, but isn't hungry. Without the Soothie pacifiers we wouldn't have anything to satisfy that.",5
"Stephen Joseph Bath Toy Caddy, Owl",Great Item for the bath fits lots of toys and very cute. Great owl water bath gift. Bright colors. Thanks,5
"GracoTravel Lite Crib With Stages, Notting Hill","This mini pack and play is perfect to keep in our bedroom for our new baby to sleep in. It's just the right size for traveling as well. I can easily take this on vacation and to the Grandparent's home if needed. My baby sleep comfortably in it at night, since she is not ready for her actual crib in her own room yet. It's very easy to open and close. I had no problems putting it together myself either (without my husband's help)  :)",5
Buggy Bagg Shopping Cart Cover - Black Toile,"For the big zipper to break within the first month of use was a pretty big disapointment.  However, is it very well padded and fits shopping charts at Costco.",3

Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"Having nursed my daughter over the past year, the Bebe Au Lait nursing cover has been an indispensable accessory that has seen perhaps the most use of any baby item we've purchased. It's a must for nursing in public except for those that are a bit more daring about their level of public breast exposure. The built-in pockets are wonderful for storing small accessories, such as the nipple shields I needed. They have also doubled as impromptu burp rags for quick, small clean-up jobs. The wire sewn into the neckline creates a convenient and discrete way to peek in on the baby as they nurse, which is rather critical when trying to get them comfortably situated and properly latched on. As a whole, the cover folds up compactly for convenient transport via diaper bag (or purse). The one challenge we encountered is that, as my daughter grew older and more active, she grew fond of waving the cover around like a flag, which sort of defeats the purpose. By the ten month mark, she no longer tolerated being hidden under the cover since it blocked her view of what was going on around her. The cover still gets five stars for being a critical part of our nursing relationship for a solid ten months. Just be aware that older babies may be less tolerant of it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This has been a life saver.  My newborn wouldn't sleep and this made it happen.  The vibration made sleeping better for her and eased her colic.  Now that she is a few months old and sleeps in her crib with no problem, the removable toys are back on the seat and keep her entertained while I'm cooking or showering.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","This is my 3 rd bundleme.  I love these they are stylish, warm and cozy.  I love this.color because it matches my stroller.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",This carseat is perfect!!! My 21 month old loves it!  He is able to sit more upright yet when he falls asleep his head doesn't fall forward like it does in his Evenflow.Setup is much easier than his Evenflow and it doesn't take up as much space in the seat.The clips are a little hard to unbuckle but I think this is just because it is brand new and 0 degrees outside.,5
